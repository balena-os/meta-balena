Subject: [PATCH] graph: aufs: durably write layer on disk before returning

This patch makes sure the layer contents are synced to disk before
reporting the ApplyDiff operation as successful. This prevents
/var/lib/docker corruption but the method used here is not the most
efficient since it will sync all the currently mounted filesystems.
