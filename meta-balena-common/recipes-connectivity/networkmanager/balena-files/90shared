# This script hooks to the "up" event of every interface
# It checks whether there is a rule commented "nm-shared-$IFNAME"
# in the FORWARD chain and if it is, removes it from its current
# position and appends to the end.
#
# This is necessary because of a race condition between NetworkManager
# and the balenaEngine when setting up their respective sets of firewall
# rules. If the balenaEngine sets up its rules last (IOW on top
# of the FORWARD chain), containers are allowed to route to the DHCP
# clients behind the shared interface. If NetworkManager sets its rules
# last, the containers will be denied access to the shared network.
#
# While the latter seems cleaner, some users actually benefit from
# the containers being able to route behind the shared interface,
# so we choose to prefer that behavior. This script overcomes
# the race condition and always sets the FORWARD rules
# as if balenaEngine came up last.
