# This script unlocks encrypted partitions on UEFI systems
# with secure boot enabled and encryption key protected by a TPM2.0
#
# The partition layout of such system is:
# sda         // Boot device
# |-sda1      // Unencrypted EFI partition, contains the bootloader and encrypted disk passphrase
# |-sda2      // Encrypted boot partition
# | `-dm-0    // Unlocked boot partition, contains balena-specifics, e.g. config.json
# |-sda3      // Encrypted rootA partition
# | `-dm-1    // Unlocked rootA partition
# |-sda4      // Encrypted rootB partition
# | `-dm-2    // Unlocked rootB partition
# |-sda5      // Encrypted state partition
# | `-dm-3    // Unlocked state partition
# `-sda6      // Encrypted data partition
#   `-dm-4    // Unlocked data partition
#
# When this script executes, it should only find the encrypted partitions.
# The script unlocks the partitions using the metadata stored in the EFI
# partition in combination with secrets stored in the TPM.
# As a result the dm-0..dm-5 devices are created.
#
# After successfully unlocking a partition, the default udev rules will
# in fact create two instances of the unlocked device:
# * /dev/dm-X - the "dm-X" part is referred to as "KNAME".
#   This is what the kernel uses internally to identify the device
# * /dev/mapper/luks-$UUID - the "luks-$UUID" part is referred to as "NAME".
#   This is a user-defined name, we chose "luks-$UUID", the same as Fedora.
# The two devices are identical and can be used interchangeably, but this
# script tries to prefer KNAME as it seems more practical for scripting.
