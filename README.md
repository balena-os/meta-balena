# Resin.io layers for Yocto

## Description
This repository enables building resin.io for various devices.

## Layers Structure
* meta-resin-common : layer which contains common recipes for all our supported platforms.
* meta-resin-* : layers which contain recipes specific to yocto versions.
* other files : README, COPYING, etc.


## Build flags

Before bitbake-ing with meta-resin support, a few flags can be changed in the conf/local.conf from the build directory.
Editing of local.conf is to be done after source-ing.
See below for explanation on such build flags.

### Production/Staging Builds

The RESIN_STAGING_BUILD variable gets injected into DISTRO_FEATURES. If RESIN_STAGING_BUILD contains 'yes' then 'resin-staging' distro feature is added.
Based on this, recipes can decide what staging specific changes are needed. By default RESIN_STAGING_BUILD is empty which corresponds to a normal build (resis-staging won't be appended to DISTRO_FEATURE).
If user wants a staging build, to use the serial console for example, RESIN_STAGING_BUILD = "yes" needs to be added to local.conf.

To make it short:

* If RESIN_STAGING_BUILD is not present in your local.conf or it doesn't include "yes" : Production build selected (default behavior)
* If RESIN_STAGING_BUILD is defined local.conf and includes "yes" : Staging build selected

### Generation of host OS update bundles

In order to generate update resin host OS bundles, edit the build's local.conf adding:

RESINHUP = "yes"

### Configure custom network manager

By default resin uses connman on host OS to provide connectivity. If you want to change and use other providers, list your packages using NETWORK_MANAGER_PACKAGES. You can add this variable to local.conf. Here is an example:

NETWORK_MANAGER_PACKAGES = "mynetworkmanager mynetworkmanager-client"

### Customizing splash

We configure all of our initial images to produce a resin logo at boot, shutdown or reboot. But we encourage any user to go and replace that logo with their own.
All you have to do is replace the splash/resin-logo.png file that you will find in the first partition of our images (boot partition) with your own image.
NOTE: As it currently stands plymouth expects the image to be named resin-logo.png.

## Devices support

### WiFi Adapters

We currently tested and provide explicit support for the following WiFi adapters:

* bcm43143 based adapters
    * Example: Official RPI WiFi adapter [link](http://thepihut.com/collections/new-products/products/official-raspberry-pi-wifi-adapter)

## How to fix various build errors

* Supervisor fails with a log similar to:
```
Step 3 : RUN chmod 700 /entry.sh
---> Running in 445fe69866f9
operation not supported
```
This is probably because of a docker bug where, if you update kernel and don't reboot, docker gets confused. The fix is to reboot your system.
