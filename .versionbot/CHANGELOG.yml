        The original 60s might be slow for some devices where balena
        is busy with a task and the hardware is slow for various
        reasons (ie. Pi1/Zero). In those cases even if the device
        is functioning correctly, the healthcheck will assess the
        device as unhealthy and restart balena and/or the supervisor.

      hash: c155f8edfa543d29c7efafe2fb6c80d633b82dc1

        The current implementation checks for the existance of the `flash-boot`

    - subject: 'resin-vars: Implement custom ssh keys service'
      hash: 6d2e43d4693208c8df9436ea1f96c844b4faeb75
      body: >
        This patch adds support for translating SSH public keys from config.json

        to an authorize_keys file. We use `authorize_keys_local` file as the

        destination file of this translation so we can differentiate in between
        keys

        brought locally from config.json and keys brought from the balena
        backend

        through os-config an avoid racing issues with this tool (os-config). The
        final

        `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in the
        dropbear

        service.


        These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be provided

        as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

        {
          [...]
          "os": {
            "sshKeys": [
              "ssh-rsa ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
              "ssh-rsa 0123456789"
            ]
          },
          [...]
        }

        Replace NM's DHCP request option "Client indentifier" with udhcpc style

      hash: 99b4e423003442a67f1fb45b1f4ae8d201c73b99
      body: |
        This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
        DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

        The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
        v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
        if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

        Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
        fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
        an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

      hash: f127232b8c7009c954f8467c32776c5fceee8c12
      body: |
        os-udevrules will parse config.json for any udev rules and copy the
        rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/key.rules

        udev rules can be passed via config.json in the following format

          "settings": {
            "udevrules": {
              "60": "single line. Remember to escape the double quotes",
              "99": "multi line \n2nd line"
           }
         }

        The above snippet will appear as /etc/udev/rules.d/60.rules
        and /etc/udev/rules.d/99.rules

        This patch bumps the balena version in meta-resin.

        The update in balena adds support to pass an argument to mobynit which
        allows mobynit to mount a rootfs from a custom path.

        The command ./mobynit -sysroot /mnt/sysroot/inactive will mount the
        rootfs partition from /mnt/sysroot/inactive and return the destination
        path in stdout.

    - subject: Fix proxy when using containers over bridge network
      hash: 3df6e1906e1138a8cd10d15ac3008685b90f75f8
      body: |
        Before multicontainer support in resin, the user container was running
        over the host's network stack which means that all the packets were
        treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication was
        redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.
        In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of bridge
        network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In this case,
        the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the redirection to
        redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.
        This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets to
        redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks too.

        As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to redsocks.
        This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if the
        redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

      body: |
        We would like resin-altboot service to run before balena starts
        resin-altboot checks if the boot configuration is set to run
        resinOS from rootA(B) but we are actually running rootB(A) due to
        something.

        If rollback-altboot triggers, it will run hooks to refresh boot files
        and reboot. There is no point starting balena in such a device state
        as that will only slow down the hooks from running.

      body: |
        This recipe adds a few systemd services and scripts that handle
        automated OS rollback functionality.

        The rollback-altboot.service checks if we are running in altboot mode
        i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But we are
        actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen if
        a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in resinOS_uEnv
        txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.

        The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change the
        bootfiles.

        The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if vpn is
        online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

      body: |
        This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.

        If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the
        partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env
        variables.

        To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following in
        their u-boot

        Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending on the
        device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether that
        is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.

        If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the boot
        partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"

        E.g. for rpi3
        CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y
        CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y
        CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000
        CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT=y
        CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_DEVPART=0:1

      body: |
        Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra
        variables upgrade_available and resin_root_part in their grub.cfg
        files.

        Check for the presense of those variables and update them if they
        exist.

        Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg

        For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the pattern
        that exists in u-boot.
        i.e.
         Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
         Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
         upgrade_available is set
         Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
         reaches 2.

        u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to reduce
        writes to sd card.

        If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the bootcount
        variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that u-boot
        starts counting.

        It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set
        upgrade_available=0

        For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot partition
        in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running hooks

        Pin down cargo deps (using Cargo.lock) to versions known working with

        With Sumo 19.0.1, when building cargo 0.25.0 we get:
        | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module `fs`
        |   --> /yocto/resin-board/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cargo-native/
        0.25.0-r0/cargo_home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/
        libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26
        let config = fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?

        This is just one example of a package that fails like this. There are
        multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this error.

        The cargo bbclass does a:
        cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release

        This has the following effect:
        NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.
        Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`

        Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned upstream.
        In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that require a
        newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0). But at the
        same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust version.
        (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)

        The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which pins
        the packages to versions which are known to work with rust 1.24.1,
        the version we use in sumo.
