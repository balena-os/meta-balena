      hash: 1340330ff26c90179950b4df774498b62c5a552f
      body: |
        When `recovery` is passed in the kernel command line, the initramfs will
        not boot into the OS but launch adbd.

        A connection can then be established via the network (if a DHCP address
        is provided) or using a USB gadget connection.

        For a network connection, the client needs to install `adb` and run:
        ```
        adb connect $IPADDR:5555
        adb shell
        ```

        Other adb commands, like pull/push of files are also available.

        Resolves #2864

                Instead of retrying to get the DUT IP address 120 times on a 1 seconds
                interval,

                let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will

                timeout too in 15 seconds:


                https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162


                So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

        The tunnel to port 22222 used by testbots communicate between the core
        container and the DUT does not allow to ssh as a non-root user.

        Run ssh from the worker to test local SSH authentication with a cloud
        user.

      hash: abf5936f0ada2d7af15c87a147e4416a403b3607
      body: |
        Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to communicate
        with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys, using
        a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear down and
        re-establish the tunnel.

        It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth test.

      hash: b2450a9df2c1a773b807652bc37e6c92ccecef35
      body: |
        Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to authenticate by
        the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on testbot the
        key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.

        Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and
        modifying the tests to use a single key.

        This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

        The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching openvpn

        As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not get to
        restart the supervisor.

        This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before
        starting it.

        step.

        how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit, openvpn
        starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is found, and
        otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.

        Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the layer.

      body: >
        Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in
        `chrony.conf`

        (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony

        will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start

        if that's the case.


        The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens

        the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and

        hitting this problem.


        This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the

        start to avoid the race condition.


        It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony

        does (see

        https://github.com/mlichvar/chrony/blob/7b197953e8add5515b7e58c4638dc55aa4bb91b7/conf.c#L1761)

        The task that applies the aufs patches is still required to support
        hostOS updates between aufs and overlay2 balenaOS versions.

        This commit adds support for 5.15 kernels and improves the branch
        selection logic to cover some corner cases.

        It also adds a test task so that we can test regressions.

      body: >
        The move to include the ABI in the target definition was done in Poky:

        d6b563710e6cc0857843433d85023d47f9f2037d


        Without much explanation in the commit, the ABI was removed in Poky:

        e4c16d11128f0e9cc2567fc9e3579e9a94988b2e


        Only to be re-introduced, also without much explanation in Poky:

        0bf2fd16273436f1cd9ea2ab99ad882e879f965d


        Then, there was a partial revert to remove the ABI again in Poky:

        66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48


        This last 66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48 commit is reverted here as

        it fails to build for ARM targets. All our boards that cover all the

        possible ABIs build with this change.

                The 243390 device specific tests assess that the hotspot
                connection is created on the intended interface. We thus
                need to ensure that the connection to the testbot is
                established using the embedded wifi chip.

                Unfortunately the standalone balena-cli package is linked to glibc

                The trade-off seems worth it for build times though.

      body: >
        Instead of querying devices w/ `fdisk -l`, glob match patterns specified

        in resin-init-flasher.conf with devices present in `/dev`. This allows us to

        specify devices like `hd? sd? mmcblk?` instead of individual device

        numbers, which don't consistently map to any particular disk.


        This also allows RAID arrays to be matched with the array name and a

        pattern that glob matches even arrays assembled automatically on a

        non-matching host, such as `md/balena?(_?)` matching an array named

        `balena` and assembled on-device at `/dev/md/balena_0`.

        These packages also install kernel images into the boot directory in the

        root partition, overwriting the initramfs kernel installed by

        kernel-image-initramfs.


        Before kirkstone, the way to not include the kernel image was to

        override the `RDEPENDS:${KERNEL_PACKAGE_NAME}-base` not to include

        `kernel-image`, as was done in the `kernel-resin-noimage` class.


        Kirkstone changes the dependency from RDEPENDS to RRECOMMENDS in

        Poky's commit f6d963fa6d0e64d53f7ef56fd2c12d67f5811829


        Now excluding the kernel image needs to `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE = "kernel-image-*"`

        This commit reverts to the previous way of setting the rust architecture.

        It will not work for ppc64le and if we would need to support such an

        architecture the arch_to_rust_arch() function will still be called if it

        exists in Kirkstone or newer Yocto versions.

        This layer allows to set a preferred version as a distro setting that can

        be used across all Yocto versions.

      hash: 7146e4614c2658d6f7d5384602eb8ad213e08759
      body: |
        Previously, our healthcheck verified if we were able to start a new
        container. This had two downsides:

        1. It was relatively heavyweight. In devices under heavy load, it would
           sometimes take so long to run that the Engine was killed by the
           watchdog.
        2. It wrote to the storage media. Creating a container involves writing
           some data to persistent storage, therefore the healthcheck was
           wearing the storage media.

        This new healthcheck simply pings both `balenad` and `containerd`, which
        is much faster than starting a new container and doesn't write to disk.
        The step of pinging `containerd` is important because we have seen at
        least one case in the past in which `balenad` was working but
        `containerd` wasn't.

        With `WatchdogSignal=SIGTERM` systemd will send a SIGTERM and give the
        Engine 90 seconds to gracefully shutdown before sending a SIGKILL. We
        had cases of Engine metadata on disk getting corrupted after the
        watchdog sent it a SIGKILL directly. This change shall minimize this
        issue.

        Our tests perform two HUPs (into and out of the release under test), and
        the code for both of these HUPs were duplicated. This commit factors
        this code out to a common function.

        This is a small improvement over our previous test: in addition to
        checking that the volumes themselves are preserved over HUPs, we now
        check if the contents of these volumes is preserved.

        Resolves #2428

      body: |
        The boot partition is currently a FAT filesystem that does not support
        atomic writes. To prevent corruption, this commit introduces a fatrw
        application that needs to be used both when reading and writing files
        to the boot partition to provide safe accesses.

              body: >
                The executeCommand family of methods default to retrying on failure. In

                some cases, such as in the ssh-auth test in the cloud test suite, we

                expect failures to happen, and want them to be raised immediately. Other

                situations might demand adjusting the number of retries and interval to

                fit specific tests. Add a retryOptions object to these methods to allow

                for this behavior to be configured.

      body: |
        By creating empty configuration units when no configuratin is applied to
        a service instead we avoid regenerating them at boot if stored in
        persistent memory helping with boot times in less powerful devices.

        This allows for specific devices to override the defaults, which is to
        store configuration units on volatile memory re-generating them every
        boot and avoiding storage media writes.

        Changing this to permanent storage trades boot times with media life
        expectancy.

        Currently `os-config-json` is also parsing `units-conf.json` at runtime.
        This is expensive to do for smaller devices, so this commit performs the
        processing at build time.

        For this, it also splits the configuration units processing in
        balena-config-vars into its own recipe to allow for task ordering.

        environment that is recreated when `config.json` changes and will be
        used if present.

        When parallelizing fingerprint checks with Promise.any(), the
        unsuccessful command would continue retrying in the background, causing
        spurious error messages.

        With mDNS resolution memoization, this optimization no longer saves us
        time, so remove it.

      body: |
        When accessing a test device as part of a fleet, a cloud API key is
        required in order to generate an SSH key and access the device through
        the VPN. However, when accessing a device locally, such as a QEMU
        instance running on the workstation itself, we have a direct path, and
        no VPN is necessary.

        Make the apiKey optional, and don't login when it's not specified. This
        allows direct connections to work without it.

        Certain chrony tests require the ability to block NTP requests. Switch
        from blocking these requests using iptables rules to simply stopping the
        local DNS server, which is faster and simpler, and doesn't conflict with
        the supervisor firewall.

        We may have cases when for some boards we do not want

        to have all these files blacklisted. See for example

        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-rockpi/commit/b5eadcfb3a296eea2554dc0cbdd16002d51c5169


        In conclusion, we rework how the blacklist is constructed

        so that users of meta-balena can alter this list as they see fit.

      body: >
        This changes the condition in the unit file from checking whether

        /dev/disk/by-state/balena-efi exists to checking whether /mnt/boot/EFI

        is a symlink. The original approach has a race condition populating

        the by-state symlink - it is depending on udev and if the link is

        not present when the service is started (after the boot partition is mounted),

        the service fails and the EFI partition is never mounted.


        The new approach does the trick pretty well - /mnt/boot/EFI is a symlink

        if the EFI partition is split and a regular directory in case there is a single

        boot partition. That said the service is only started when necessary

        and the waiting for udev is implemented as a part of the mount script.

        When calling waitUntil(), reduce calling intervals and the total number
        of retries. This effectively halves the runtime for these tests, as the
        latency for detecting success is much lower.

        When tests execute quicker, a race condition can occur where config.json
        is edited to remove the dnsServers property, but /run/dnsmasq.servers is
        not changed yet. This causes the test to fail, as the file is not empty.

            not ok 1 - We should have an empty /run/dnsmasq.servers file.

              hash: 6f12d0abb3e438f26a18eee9bbaeca9c4702f7e7
              body: >
                The root cause of this issue was an integer overflow in 32-bit platforms

                -- specifically, when explicitly converting `io.Reader` offsets

                (`int64`) to slice indices (`int`, which is only 32-bit long on 32-bit

                platforms).


                We already had in place the checks supposed to ensure slice bounds where

                always within the expected bounds. So, in a way, this commit just

                re-organizes the code so that we perform safely this required `int64` to

                `int` type conversion.

                Splash image backend would throw if the image is not a valid png during

                the write step. This could prevent the device from provisioning if some

                corruption happens at some point.

                This commit updates all backends that write to /mnt/boot to do it

                through a new `lib/host-utils` module. Writes are now done using write +

                sync as rename is not an atomic operation in vfat.


                The change also applies for writes through the `/v1/host-config`

                endpoint.


                Finally this change includes some improvements on tests.

                The status field does not indicate the current state of the Engine on the
                device.

                Rather, it only indicates whether the HTTP response returned successfully or not.


                To get the current state of the device, i.e. whether it has applied target state or not,

                use the `appState` field in the response.

                The linked issue describes the Supervisor not cleaning up locks it creates
                due

                to crashing at just the wrong time. After internal discussion we decided to

                differentiate Supervisor-created lockfiles from user-created lockfiles by using

                the `nobody` UID (65534) for Supervisor-created lockfiles.


                As the existing NPM lockfile lib does not allow creating lockfiles atomically

                with different UIDs, we move to using the lockfile binary, which is part of the

                procmail package. To allow nonroot users to write to lock directories, permissions

                are changed to allow write access by nonroot users.

      body: >
        This reverts 5047757 where we set the global DHCP timeout for ipv4 to

        infinity to mitigate problems with routers that do not respond to DHCP

        requests in time.


        This however causes issues on some routers, which after power cycle fail to

        renew leases after they are expired.


        The same ipv4.dhcp-timeout can be specified on per connection basis. Since

        the case with lease renewal due to router power cycle is a more common case,

        it is better to keep the global dhcp-timeout default unmodified. If the

        setting needs adjustment then it can be overwritten in the particular

        connection profile.

    - subject: Disable Engine startup timeouts
      hash: c4ce541526455c8cb891e7c76889e0d4cb2735b1
      body: |
        There are known situations in which balenaEngine times out during
        initialization (for example, during aufs to overlayfs migrations, or
        when restarting a device that was running a large number of containers).
        When these time outs occur, Systemd kills the Engine, causing further
        problems.

        To avoid these cases, this commit disables timeouts during the Engine
        initialization.

        This is also aligned with the default Systemd settings distributed with
        the Moby project.

                This adds two new integration tests:


                * TestDeltaSize: this is meant to catch regressions on delta sizes. It
                  generates deltas and compare their sizes with the delta sizes we get
                  as of now. If the size increases, the test fails.
                * TestDeltaCorrectness: checks if applying a delta indeed results in the
                  same image as we had originally.

                A number of different test cases (different images with distinct

                features) are tested for each of these integration tests.

        Let's ensure tools like fixdep are built in container

        may not run if they were linked against a different
        version of libc that may not be available in the kernel
        modules build container.

        This fixes the following error encountered when doing
        a Poky Honister build for the balena-intel repository:

      body: >
        This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel patch
        backported

        from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when secure boot

        is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the kernel patch

        and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file that enables

        lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


        That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it and it adds

        extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no point keeping

        it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel to know

        whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back and rebase.

        do not allow dashboard based updates) and openBalena use cases.

        was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,

        building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing

        headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible

        only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

        gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

        failed check in the above mentioned patch.


        Since we are not using the functions provided

        by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

        config.

    - subject: Use by-state symlink for mounting the EFI partition when split
      hash: 42d8ac8daaee2a67d5666c7220e1b9cd0e013e6e
      body: >
        In the current state the by-state symlink for balena-efi partition

        is not generated for two reasons:

        - 60-resin-update-state.rules only react to resin-* partition names

        - the root device is not identified correctly in resin_update_state_probe
          for LUKS devices

        This patch fixes both the issues and makes use of the by-state symlink

        instead of by-label.

      hash: aa76a9b45e18192ecaa67f17ef68f9cfc4d66a66
      body: >
        This patch adds the check for PCRs

        - 0 - firmware/UEFI blob

        - 1 - firmware/UEFI config

        - 2 - Expansion card firmware blobs

        - 3 - Expansion card firmware configs


        The full protection is only applied on first boot after provisioning,

        flasher only locks against PCRs 0, 2 and 3.

        This is because when using flasher, the environment is not in the same

        state as the one we want to lock to. In particular the boot order is

        different (flasher is booted from a different drive than the resulting OS).

        As for now we were not able to find a better solution than fully locking

        only on first boot. This means the device must be booted in a secure

        environment at least once after provisioning.

                The moby engine v20.x.y adds some selinux [security

                depending on the [container configuration](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/create.go#L214).

                This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the

                current and target service configurations will never match. The

                supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are

                not supported by balenaOS.

                This brings all migration logic into a single call into the

                storagemigration package, which should make future maintenance easier

                and fixes the cleanup logic bug, where the old aufs root would never be

                cleaned up.

              hash: 582487f832c59c2f734a780ab0492833f29002c9
              body: >
                This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads after failures with

                the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                large layers and unreliable network connections.


                These are the changes:


                * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                  This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                  and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                  immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                  network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                  The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                  continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                  strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                  will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                Busybox in balenaOS is compiled with desktop mode disabled,
                so features like `-ef` and providing pids via `-q` are not
                supported. Add a 3rd condition to try ps with no args and allow
                parsePSOutput to filter by pid.

                Earlier engine versions were not properly persisting cacheID

                in layer metadata. As a result, because of abruptly terminated transactions,

                a lot of devices have unreferenced graphdriver layers on disk.


                With this change, the engine will be able to clean up such unreferenced layers.

                When layer store is created, its tmp directory may contain information

                about transactions that were abruptly treminated during the previous process run.

                Such data is now identified before any new transactions can be created,

                and a background process is started to delete both meta data and graph driver layeres.

                If the engine process is terminated during the layer extraction
                transaction,

                before Commit or Cancel is called on the transaction, a new FS layer can be created

                by the graph driver without any link to the layers metadata.


                This change ensures we don't perform any actions on the graph driver storage until

                the FS layer ID (the cacheID) is  persisted as a part of the transaction data.


                We can use this data to clean up the graph driver storage on next process start

                deleting all data associated with the transactions terminated abruptly.

      body: |
        The prepare-openvpn service needs to be restarted to regenerate the
        VPN keys when provisioning is finished and the `apiKey` is removed.

        Note that flasher images make changes to `/mnt/boottmp/config.json` so
        we still need to manually kick `prepare-openvpn` in
        `resin-device-register`, which is preferable to modifying services to
        watch multiple paths.

        Upstream kernel added a new fkms overlay for

        from overlay-map, however, we were not aware
        of this.

        Let's add a vcdbg testcase to warn in case the RPi
        firmware fails to load any overlay or dtb, and set
        gpu_mem to 64 so that vcdbg can run.

    - subject: "openvpn: Remove dependency on timesync-http target"
      hash: 13cf7c9fef0a6e0df6b042ba34ceaa7a0d005254
      body: >
        We want the VPN to start unconditionally even if the connectivity URL

        is not reachable.


        The rationale for adding the dependency in the first place was that

        without an initial timesync certificate checks may fail. This can still

        happen, but the VPN will retry continuously and eventually succeed once

        the time is synched.


        What happens now is that the VPN is delayed until the http sync, so if

        the connectivity URL is blocked or unreachable, but the internet is

        accessible, VPN will not even launch and no remote debugging is possible.


        Fixes #2508

        This commit removes all config-json.target instances in preparation for
        the introduction of a better, more fine grained mechanism.

        If resin-init-flasher.conf has LUKS=1 flasher will:
        - Add extra 2MB to each partition for the LUKS header
        - Split resin-boot into EFI and linux boot
        - LUKS-format the partitions, copy image contents after unlocking
        - Propagate signatures for secure boot

        The default behavior (LUKS undefined) is unchanged

      body: |
        We add this this check since we discovered
        that with newer boot firmware the Pi4 will
        not reboot when under-voltage is reported.

        We don't mark the test as failed in
        this case, since there may be devices that
        continue to work even if under-powered and we
        don't want to block or delay development if the
        DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
        easily.

        This check provides an indication for further
        debugging of failed test cases.

      body: |
        When resizing the filesystem fails, such as when resize2fs won't touch
        it because it's dirty, the partition gets resized, but not the
        filesystem. The script will not attempt to resize the filesystem again,
        as it detects the partition has already been resized.

        Split these actions apart, so that the filesystem resize is always
        attempted. If resize2fs detects that the filesystem is already filling
        available space, it will exit with no action taken.

        Let's only apply this code to pre-warrior as intended. Starting
        with warrior this code is in poky so we can rely on it from
        there instead of keeping a duplicate in meta-balena-common.
        This helps with BSPs that may define their own tasks (configure,
        compile and so on) for u-boot (keeping this fragments merging
        code in meta-balena-common would have the effect of overwriting
        these tasks from here and thus breaking the build).

      hash: 4823b0299002192820d36c90e5d2dfd9ff122ff5
      body: |
        The chrony driftfile is not being updated at shutdown due to an
        incorrect mount service dependency in the systemd chronyd.service
        file. The current dependency on 'var-volatile-lib' does not cover the
        subsequent bind mounting of the '/var/lib/chrony' sub-directory, so
        the chrony directory gets unmounted at shutdown before the drift file
        has been updated.

        This issue is solved by changing the mount service dependency from
        'var-volatile-lib' to 'bind-var-lib-chrony' (which is similar to the
        way bind mount dependencies are already handled for the NetworkManager
        and bluetooth services).

        On transitioning from the initramfs to the rootfs, the udev database is

        However, dm devices are flagged not to be re-processed, so we need to
        set a sticky bit on them so they persist the cleanup.

      body: >
        From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run directory in the

        root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not

        there.


        Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use /tmp

        to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

        generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


        However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is recreated

        on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems for DM

        devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not re-processed

        by udevd.


        This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may implement

        disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains backwards

        compatible for HUP from older releases.

        Some BSPs name the u-boot such as u-boot-imx_2020 for example.

        This PR is a first pass at solving this by moving at least the
        SRC_URI appending part from this bbappend and into the
        resin-u-boot.bbclass instead. Further investigation is needed
        to see if we can remove this bbappend altogether since we may
        have all boards using Poky Warrior or newer, making this
        u-boot bbappend obsolete.

        The CM4 IO-Board was the first device
        which exhibited an issue in which
        the MAC address was set to an
        unprogrammed value AA:AA:AA...:AA.

        We've addressed this in the device repo,
        meanwhile it has been fixed in upstream
        too, so let's check and catch this should
        it happen again.

        It also fixes the file name for the detached signature, which must match

        the name of the associated file.

      hash: 2bb18707557979ed6466f45602de4ecf5b386c57
      body: |
        Add a new timesync-https systemd service to synchronise the system
        time at boot using an HTTPS header. The service uses curl to request
        an HTTPS header from either $API_ENDPOINT/connectivity-check (default)
        or the URL defined by the os.network.connectivity.uri field in
        config.json. The URL used *must* return HTTP code 204 (No Content)
        in response to a request so that we can determine that we have full
        network connectivity and are not operating behind a captive portal.

        The date field returned by a valid header is used to set the current
        system time. The date/time derived from the header is assumed to be a
        reasonable source of 'truth' such that it can be used to adjust the
        system time both backwards and forwards. This will compensate for any
        erroneous timestamps saved via fake-hwclock or any invalid data
        read from an RTC.

        The service will exit when a valid response has been received. Poll
        attempts will be made at an increasing interval starting at 2s and
        doubling up to a maximum of 64s. Polling will continue at the maximum
        interval until a valid response has been received.

        This service will provide initial time synchronisation for devices
        where NTP ports have been blocked. For devices where NTP access is
        available it should ensure that any system 'time jump' is only a few
        seconds when NTP synchronisation is eventually achieved. It also
        allows other services to start with a reasonably accurate time
        without having to wait for the NTP synchronisation process to
        complete.

        Services that are ordered after the new time-sync-https-wait target
        can be sure that full network connectivity has been achieved and that
        time has been synchronised with an accuracy of a few seconds.

        The interface test uses a simple ping to ensure a specific interface

        test while not adding anything of value.

        Reduce the timeout to the minimum non-privileged interval of 2ms.

        and eventually mount with no further checks.


        This also adds graceful handling of nonexistent variables since not all

        UEFI implementations come with secure boot support.

        GRUB can not use the TPM easily to unlock the volumes and find the kernel

        on an encrypted partition. Instead, we choose to store a linux kernel

        and use it as 2nd stage bootloader to unlock the partition, load the actual

        kernel and kexec into it. This should eventually be replaced by a proper

        2nd stage bootloader that is being worked on.

        Currently the two classes would keep the original files untouched and
        store

        the signed versions as .signed. This patch reverses the logic - the signed

        files replace the original ones and the unsigned version is stored as .unsigned.

        This is because there is no real use-case for the unsigned files, we always

        want to ship the signed version, even if the particular DT does not require it,

        this causes no harm.

      body: |
        Previously, the core service exposed a /proxy endpoint that would start
        up a proxy remotely, which would be used by a test in the connectivity
        module. However, the endpoint returned the address for the testbot to be
        used as the proxy in the response, and this required manual
        configuration of the interface. Additionally, it requires the worker
        service to install and provide glider for forward proxying.

        Move the proxy (glider) to a container on the device being tested,
        which simplifies configuration, and reduces the complexity and size of
        the interface of Leviathan.

        Add a test to wait for the chronyd service to become active before
        starting the time sync tests.

        The current chronyd tests assume that the chronyd service is
        instantly available at boot time. With the addition of the new
        HTTPS time synchronisation service the starting of chronyd can be
        delayed by a few seconds so we need to ensure that the service
        is actually running before proceeding.

      hash: 7dde2133a5b1df710255b8b0471385cca1449c1d
      body: >
        When user namespacing was enabled in the kernel by default, a separate

        commit [0] was introduced to disable the feature at runtime, to allow

        users/administrators to explicitly choose to enable it, avoiding

        potential security implications.


        However, some applications such as Chromium's sandbox, require either

        SUID or user namespacing to work. Disabling this feature on boards

        that previously enabled it necessitates container modifications and

        potentially breaks previously working applications.


        Create a distro feature to disable user namespacing by default in

        meta-balena, while allowing device types to keep it enabled to maintain

        compatibility with their original behavior.

      body: |
        At runtime we can now enable development features that were previously
        configured using the development-image feature. That feature also
        configured U-Boot for OS development.

        Now we have two distinct functionalities:

        * A runtime development configuration variable that configures the
        device to facilitate application development
        * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for BSP and OS
        development

        This allows us to merge the current production/development images into
        a single image.

        the new OS anymore. This is necessary only when updating from older
        OS versions in which the supervisor adds the isolcpus

                the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)

                failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling

                of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored

                as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the

                dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.


                This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor

                journal logs as


                ```

                getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                    at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                ```


                Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image

                name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the

                supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the

                database should be side effect free.

                Preparing for the new v3 target state, where the supervisor will make
                environment

                dependent ids optional and rely on using general UUIDs and user known identifiers

                for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction by removing some of those

                comparisons for v2 target state.


                - imageId to be replaced with imageName

                - serviceId to be replace by serviceName

                - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future release_uuid)


                This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it doesn't completely get rid of

                these identifiers (which are still being used by supervisor API and for state

                patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for calculating steps to target state.

              hash: f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19
              body: >
                The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker IDs as the main

                way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if the target

                state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the supervisor will always use

                the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to tag the image on

                the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to ensure

                consistency is maintained between the database and the engine.


                Using tags allows to simplify query and removal operations, since now

                removing the image now means removing tags matching the image name.


                Before this change the supervisor relied only on information in the

                supervisor database, and used that to remove images by docker ID. However, the docker

                id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the same id between

                releases or between services in the same release.

                The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex instance from the

                db module but that was leading to issues when running tests using `test:fast`.

                This provides a fix for the test module that just removes the destroy

                call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

        Change the NetworkManager NTP dispatcher script to update the

        instead of 'up/down' events.

        Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any
        network interface. It makes more sense to run it for
        'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in whether
        the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is
        up or down.

      hash: 31c3ae8ad5c7ad45e450349b6972524da120e96c
      body: |
        Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing enabled
        in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and Ubuntu,
        default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user
        namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in the
        kernel.

        Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more conservative,
        disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian
        maintains its own patch to add the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone
        tunable.

        The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of application
        developers not using this feature due to it being generally unavailable
        in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.

        RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max number of
        user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but without
        an out of tree patch.

        Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as RHEL, in
        the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have chosen.

        596b0474d3d9b1242eab713f84d8873f9887d980 for details.

        Hence we use in meta-balena-dunfell the upstream kernel-devsrc from the
        hardknott-3.3.1 Poky release which handles this module.lds move.

              hash: 582487f832c59c2f734a780ab0492833f29002c9
              body: >
                This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads after failures with

                the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                large layers and unreliable network connections.


                These are the changes:


                * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                  This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                  and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                  immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                  network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                  The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                  continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                  strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                  will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                Similarly when processing the destination layers to generate deltas we

                only hold one reference at a time, leaving the subsequent layers

                vulnerable to the same issues.

        Since we don't have devices using older 3.x kernels we update to a newer

        This avoids a compile error on kernel 5.10.31 on arm64
        raspberrypicm4-ioboard for example where it would complain _mcount is
        undefined because the older gcc in the intel-nuc-debian:stretch-20190717
        base image would not create the _mcount symbol when compiling against
        the newer 5.10.31 kernel.

        Replace the IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE magic number with a calculation based on
        the partition sizes on the balena image classes.

        The rootfs size is calculated with the assumption of a total BalenaOS
        size of 700M. This includes boot, state, rootA and rootB partitions. The
        data partition will then grow to occupy the rest of the storage media.

        Device integration layers can override this value if needed.

      hash: a6781d54c6edced457ad916cac3fec9c70d25a0a
      body: |
        Add a new systemd service to check for full network connectivity.
        This service is required because the default NetworkManager (NM)
        connectivity checker doesn't differentiate between the
        CONNECTED_LOCAL, CONNECTED_SITE and CONNECTED_GLOBAL states. This
        service checks for the CONNECTED_GLOBAL state only and can be used
        to delay the start of other services which require full network
        access to be available. This can help to avoid startup problems on
        networks with slow DNS access or that utilise a captive portal.

        The script does an initial oneshot check of the NM state to make sure
        that we don't wait for an event that doesn't come. This check is
        redundant at boot time due to the fact that the service is started
        before NM to ensure that no NM DBus events are missed. The initial
        check is useful in circumstances where you want to run the script
        standalone or post-boot.

        Other services that wish to make use of this service and wait for
        full network connectivity should add the following entries to their
        systemd unit definition:

        Requires=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target
        After=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

        This makes it easier to overwrite the arguments passed in the engine

        unit from drop-in overwrites. See the development image drop-in unit for

        reference.


        Using `systemctl edit --runtime balena.service`, which puts those

        overwrites into `/run/systemd/system/balena.service.d/`, it would be

        possible to modify the runtime behavior of the engine without remounting

        the rootfs to be writeable.

    - subject: Add oneshot service to migrate supervisor state config
      hash: d965d23fe60db6254eaabd81a0d48b5718e01a3a
      body: |
        The hostapp-update hooks would run before the supervisor update step
        when using balenahup via the dashboard. This resulted in the balena
        supervisor state conf file being out-of-date.

        This commit removes the hostapp-update hook and instead uses a
        oneshot service to ensure the conf is migrated if it does not exist
        in the new path before starting the supervisor.

      hash: ac0ba89f14c0b04b7353192f15a0634be44d910c
      body: >
        Some BSPs have enabled CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC which

        can trigger panics upon high iowait, such as balena-engine

        downloading/writing a large image to disk.


        Kconfig says the following:

            Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on "hung tasks",
            which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck
            in uninterruptible "D" state.

            The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
            to cause the system to reboot automatically after a
            hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for
            high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and
            where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.

            Say N if unsure.

        Hung tasks are not normally terminal, nor do they affect system

        stability, but panicking during an image write forces a device into a

        bootloop that requires manual intervention to remedy.


        See the below stacktrace:

        balena-engine hasn't transitioned to building with modules yet, and Go
        1.16 enabled them by default. Revert to the old behavior for now to fix
          the build.

        This option will be removed in Go 1.17, so we'll have to update our
        build before upgrading further.

    - subject: "balena-config-vars: improve handling of NM config parameters"
      hash: 61280e84e045a4b235a21eec194fc8cf894c310d
      body: |
        Improve the handling of the os.network.* parameters defined in
        config.json.

        The balena-config-vars script has been updated to process the
        os.network.* parameters from config.json. This allows scripts
        to access these parameters by just including balena-config-vars
        rather than having to parse them directly. Some of the default
        settings have now been included as part of the jq parsing string.
        The jq command has also been assigned to an interim variable rather
        than being evaluated directly. This allows other scripts which
        include balena-config-vars to handle parsing errors correctly when
        they are running with 'set -e'.

        The os-networkmanager script has been updated to make use of the
        balena-config-vars script and no longer parses config.json itself.
        The logging has been standardised and the simplification of the
        variable processing has reduced the size of the script from 146
        to 101 lines.

        The build time tests have been removed as the os-networkmanager script
        is unable to access /usr/sbin/balena-config-vars at buildtime.

              hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a
              body: >
                A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam config,

                checking that both network and subnet are defined for each ipam config entry

                (as described in the docker documentation).


                After that PR, the validations throws an exception if the network target state is incorrect,

                but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because that exception is also triggered

                when querying target state.


                This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in local mode, because local

                mode queries the old target state before sending a new one. Since the query fails,

                the CLI can never push the new target state.


                This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the logs, since a

                misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures, it will just

                prevent containers to communicate through the provided network.


                A future improvement should move this validation to an earlier point in the process,

                so the target state can get rejected before it even gets to a point it

                can be used.

                'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
                and util.promisify for faster native methods.
                'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                contained within express v4.x.

      body: |
        We need to make sure the modem is completely initialized before sending
        the AT commands that do the switch to ECM mode. To achieve this we
        change the systemd service dependency to depend on ModemManager.service
        and then we determine the modem state by using mmcli and querying the
        modem power-state property.

        This procedure will only be done once. After the modem is placed in ECM
        mode, it will stay in this mode for future reboots so there will be no
        other delays in bringing up the modem connection.

    - subject: "resin-mounts/etc-fake-hwclock: add dependency on resin-state services"
      hash: 2b07011844a2738aec033d88af29e3f6e0dd28a2
      body: |
        Added a dependency on resin-state.service and resin-state-reset.service
        to etc-fake-hwclock.mount.

        On initial boot after flashing a device the resin-state-reset.service
        was running after etc-fake-hwclock.mount causing the bind mount point
        /mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/fake-hwclock to be deleted after it had
        been mounted. This resulted in a failure to save the date/time at
        shutdown which caused problems with persistent logging at next boot.
        Subsequent boots are unaffected as resin-state-reset does not run.
        Adding a dependency on the resin-state services ensures that the
        bind mount point is created after the state reset has been performed.

        This issue was noticed when running the testbot unmanaged OS image
        persistent logging test. When running a managed OS image the device
        normally reboots fairly immediately after connecting to the
        balena-cloud host and receiving parameter updates, so this issue is
        not usually noticeable.

        the udev rule to skip such devices and only trigger on add or change
        events.

      hash: 7983e9bfd716aaedad1ef5f1468b2771e1f5a71c
      body: |
        Previously we were loading the healthcheck image from it's own service
        that was previously made `PartOf=` the balena.service.
        This was done in an attempt to help get the system unstuck when the
        image is removed (like through manual pruning), which would cause the
        healthcheck to trigger the engine to reboot until the load service was
        restarted by hand.

        Further investigation found a race between the first execution of the
        engine healthcheck script (which needs the image to be loaded) and the
        loader service itself, which would lead to a similar state, requireing
        manual intervention.

        This change moves the loading into the healthcheck script itself,
        allowing us to remove the loader script and service entirely, skipping
        the whole service ordering issue.

      hash: 5e1004d6753025166c40b11af117e008feb875f1
      body: |
        grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition, and
        resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.

        A normal grub installation installs those modules to ${PREFIX}/${libdir}
        to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're building the
        image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.

        The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these
        constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to
        ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This had the
        unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases, such as
        clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps of the
        build.

        Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append the
        required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub image
        without any external modules at all.

      hash: d16ad58f6efe76c9313226735de88648e54d2420
      body: >
        If the device with flasher rootfs is slow to bring up and rootfs is
        defined

        as UUID=xxx the waiting loop in rootfs initrd script would assume UUIDs have

        just been regenerated and wait for a by-state symlink instead. This only works

        for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated UUIDs

        therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

      hash: 7d6ec3d411af78b9b1f979b90461e9efb059e4e7
      body: |
        Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount
        unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).

        Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock directory
        results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the same
        directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods try to
        unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory being
        unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save the
        system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time
        at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

      body: |
        Update the existing DHCP dispatcher script for adding NTP sources to
        make use of dynamic chrony source configuration. Any DHCP configured
        NTP sources for a particular interface are added to a sources file on
        network 'up' or DHCP lease renewal events. Any DHCP configured NTP
        sources for a particular interface are deleted on network 'down'
        events. Changes to the sources file are picked up by chrony either
        when it starts up or at runtime using the chrony-helper script.

        Add a dispatcher script to trigger the chrony online/offline
        status on network 'up' and 'down' events. This will make chrony
        re-run an iburst for sources when the appropriate network interface
        comes back up.

      body: >
        Fixes #2075


        Needed were a number of various changes to make the package compile properly:


        Removed is 0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that is now

        included upstream.


        Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is reworked for ease of

        maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to debug level.


        Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a wrong version number.


        The following additional configuration options were added/removed:


        *. Introspection is disabled through `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

        not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is no longer needed

        0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


        *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is disabled as we do not

        use firewalld.


        *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so `--enable-polkit-agent` and

        `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

    - subject: replace busybox ps with procps [klutchell]
      hash: 00556af37cf241e2b95d9b719f1ab58cc9bbddb6
      body: >
        Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

        any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

        from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


        By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

        such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of this

        when compiled in "desktop" mode.


        This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary into

        a separate procps package:


        - https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90


        So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into compat branches

        and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than gatesgarth.

    - subject: Fix pppd timeout when launched by NetworkManager
      hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c
      body: |
        Fixes #1846

        UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under
        balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to establish
        ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.

        This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to `/etc/ppp/options`
        to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.

        The connect option specifies an external script to establish the
        physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is
        ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing it
        to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

        Starting with dee971c0dbeb6e8363f3e321af582e99627626e9, flasher
        images, which don't contain a supervisor version, try to register
        in the API using the parameter supervisor_version='null'.

        However, the API expects this parameter to be unset completely if
        there's no version to be reported during registration, otherwise
        the call fails and the device doesn't show up in dashboard during
        flashing or report the post-provisioning state.

        This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle and ignores

        container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it read-only though,

        any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

        Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and

        Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
        upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
        version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
        as well.

        - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
        - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
          as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
        - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
        - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
          online state.

        We have no use for u-boot-initial-env and enabling it would require

        additional changes in do_compile to match the commit linked above.

      hash: ce9e4f211a2356a866edee5ca3dbada3faa27689
      body: |
        Ensure that the /var/log/supervisor-log directory exists prior to
        running 'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' as well as
        'runSupervisor'.

        Updates to the 'start-resin-supervisor' script in v2.62.1 removed
        the check for updates to the REGISTRY_ENDPOINT variable. Previously
        this had been detected as changing every time the script was run
        due to a comparison between 'null' and ''. This resulted in the
        'start-resin-supervisor' script always running through the
        'runSupervisor' path. With this variable check removed, and no config
        updates being detected, the script was trying to run
        'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' and failing due to the
        absence of the /var/log/supervisor-log directory. To fix this problem we
        unconditionally test for and create this directory (if necessary) so
        that it is available regardless of the path taken through the script.

      hash: 447449808ef08577712db43b1042599ad4d7d23c
      body: |
        Change the chrony UDP source port from 123 (privileged) to
        1234 (non-privileged).

        Previous issues with Phicomm routers had required the use of a fixed
        UDP source port, so port 123 was chosen as this is used by both ntpd
        and ntpdate. However recent testing has shown that using a privileged
        port such as 123 can cause issues on other networks. By changing the
        port to be non-privileged (i.e. 1234) we can satisfy both network
        requirements.

      hash: 1c1374f3c8b5914b7e645f8068ebafc8b4cbbe3a
      body: |
        The handling of the RTC at boot time has been improved as follows:

        1) A 'timeinit-rtc.sh' script has been added to improve logging of
           system time updates from the RTC and to prevent system time
           being set when RTC time is behind system time. If RTC time is
           found to be behind system time a warning is issued regarding
           potential RTC battery failure.

        2) The 'timeinit-rtc.service' has been added to the new systemd
           'time-set.target'. This allows for better control and
           co-ordination between the various time source services.

        3) Systemd dependencies have been updated to ensure that the
           RTC is the final time service before the 'time-set.target'
           is reached.

        The 'timeinit-buildtime.sh' script has been updated to use the
        new support functions provided by the 'os-helpers-time' script.

                ```


                Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image database entries

                with the same dockerId (this is because of how the engine handles this

                particular case). This case is not handled by the removal process

                leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

                The memory information reported by the supervisor currently

                estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal - MemFree`.

                However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as much

                memory as possible, which will affect the output of `MemFree`

                (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage seen

                by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much greater than

                it is.


                The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree - Buffers - Cached`,

                which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free` commands.

                With the addition of the system information feature (CPU temp) etc if

                there wasn't any changes in the docker or config state of the device,

                updates in system information would not be sent to the API. Now we

                attempt to send data once every maxReportFrequency (although this does

                not mean that we will be sending data that often, we still only send the

                delta, if one exists)

                When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the supervisor currently

                gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See #1465


                This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration, which lead to

                the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when no change was

                needed.

                Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor API, will

                now get an individual key which can be scoped to specific resources.

                In this iteration the default scope will be to the application that

                the service belongs to.


                We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud API when in

                managed mode.

        By default chrony uses a random UDP source port for each NTP request.
        This can cause problems with particular routers/firewalls (issues have
        been reported for the Phicomm KE 2P).

        The chrony `acquisitionport` configuration setting has been added
        to the chrony.conf file to change the UDP source port for NTP requests
        to 123 (this is the same as the default source port used by both
        ntpdate and ntpd).

        Drop the '-s' command line parameter from chronyd as:
        a) restoring time from the drift file is no longer necessary due to
        the fake-hwclock service, and
        b) restoring time from the RTC is already covered by the timeinit-rtc
        service.

      hash: 96c2c495819ba6175261a5179e1cdb4673552e6c
      body: |
        In order to produce sensible timestamps for journald log messages:
        a) the system time needs to be maintained correctly over a reboot, and
        b) the system time needs to be set before journald is started.

        Currently the system time is maintained over reboots on systems
        without an RTC using the last modified time of the chrony drift file.
        However there are a couple of issues with this approach:

        a) /var/lib/chrony/ is not mounted early enough in the boot process
        to be available for setting the time before journald is started.
        b) there is an issue with the current systemd dependencies that result
        in the last modified time of the drift file not being updated when the
        system is shutdown or rebooted (see #1995).

        The Debian fake-hwclock service (as used by Raspberry Pi OS) has been
        added to overcome these issues.

        The fake-hwclock service will save and restore the system time from
        the fake-hwclock.data file (in /etc/fake-hwclock/). The system time
        is loaded from this file at boot and saved to it on shutdown. An
        additional timer service has been added to update the file on an
        hourly basis to cater for unexpected shutdown scenarios, e.g. power
        failure.

        The timeinit-timestamp service has improved logging and has been
        renamed to timeinit-buildtime for clarity.

        A new time-set.target has been added as per upstream systemd and
        the fake-hwclock and timeinit-buildtime services have been added
        to it.

        If the rootfs is on a slow-to-bring-up device (e.g. RPi4 + USB)
        the fsuuidsinit_enabled() function may return before the balena symlinks
        are created. This gets wrongly interpreted as missing UUIDs leading to
        a chain of failures in the subsequent scripts.
        This patch moves the symlink waiting loop from fsuuidsinit_run()
        to fsuuids_enabled() before the first usage of the symlink.

                Due to switching to Alpine the ability to resolve mDNS
                hostnames was lost. This patch overrides the lookup and
                manually resolves the names.

                        The change type is considered 'major' because, by default, errors are

                        now thrown for relatively common occurrences such as authentication

                        failures when pulling from private registries, and library users may

                        have to adapt.

                                This is a hack, and should be reverted once we get to the bottom of it.

                                It will impact performance, but right now there are things that should

                                be filtered and are not, so lets get this merged for security purposes.

                                Hopefully this library will be re-written soon.

                        Handlebars supports very basic if condition checking, but it only checks
                        for

                        existence of a field. There are times when we want to combine conditions in order

                        to generate something as part of a blueprint, without defining a completely separate

                        blueprint for it (like generating network config schema if a dt has a wifi chip or

                        a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

        In b791055f3f6ffd6cc5796569a7321c5060129eea I attempted to have flasher
        images report their preconfigured supervisor version without a good
        understanding of how flasher images work. As it turns out no supervisor
        information is maintained in the flasher image itself, so until that is
        sorted stop reporting a blank string for the supervisor version.

        Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files underneath
        it will change during runtime.

        OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor reboots the device during a HUP,

        which in turn bricks the device.


        Additionally, since unknown args cause this update to fail-closed,

        remove that barrier to future-proof more flag expansion.

      hash: 7be7738c655e37e48c1a98f9e1e0ff2795d66bf8
      body: |
        On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the supervisor moved
        from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit creation of
        directories instead of files.

        However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory, these have
        to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create them.

        This commit checks for the existence of the /var/log/supervisor-log
        directory and creates it if required.

        In rocko, systemd kills any script started in background,
        same thing happening to children that get re-parented.

        One solution to this is to use a separate service file for
        starting the healtcheck image load script, after balena.service
        was started.

        Otherwise, as util-linux has a higher default alternative priority, the

        version in util-linux is chosen. It would seem they are exchangeable, but

        the busybox version reportedly works even if the RTC interrupt line is not

        connected.

      hash: a93bd242d37246da83c1fa4368174d89b5c045f4
      body: |
        On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the supervisor moved
        from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit creation of
        directories instead of files.

        However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory, these have
        to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create them.

        This commit checks for the existence of the /resin-data/resin-supervisor
        directory and creates it if required.

        If the resin-logo.png was unmodified, it will forcefully replace to
        balena-logo.png to force rebranding of older resin branded release.

        The `docker` Docker Hub repository lists what versions of the image

        are supported and 18.6 is not among them at all. Use the current stable

        line of 18.09 instead, to stay on supported versions. See more info at:

        https://hub.docker.com/_/docker


        For more reproducability, we are also including the patch level version

        of the container, which will give us more responsibility to update more

        frequently, but fewer surprises.


        Also explicitly set `DOCKER_HOST` for the daemon being started, otherwise

        the base image's setting might silently take over, and modify this.


        Replace deprecated `-g` (graph driver) with `--data-root` as well.

      body: |
        resin-init has a hardcoded command to disable power management
        on wlan0. This commit moves the logic to udev rule as there is
        no guarantee wlan0 is the only or default wlan adapter in the system.

        There seems to be no better way to identify a wlan device in udev
        than KERNEL=="wl*" which should match both net.ifnames=0 (wlanX)
        and net.ifnames=1 (wlpX).

                The host config variable HOST_DISCOVERABILITY can be set to
                true or false, controlling the state of the avahi service. This
                determines if the device advertises it's presence over mDNS.

                Controlled by BALENA_HOST_FIREWALL_MODE, the firewall can
                either be 'on' or 'off'.

                - In the 'off' state, all traffic is allowed.
                - In the 'on' state, only traffic for the core services provided
                  by Balena is allowed.

                In the absence of an upstream implementation of the DeviceRequest API
                introduced

                as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a feature label.


                As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the default behavior of

                docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the `gpu` capabilty.

                The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA driver; here:

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go


                Background on the composefile implementation:

                We were treating the database class as a singleton, but still having to
                pass

                around the db instance. Now we can simply require the db module and have

                access to the database handle.

      body: |
        This enables a compressed RAM swap of 25% of total system memory or 1GB,
        whichever smallest.

        Upstream Yocto has a zram implementation that's broken in warrior, and a
        new implementation introduced in Zeus that does not work in BalenaOS as
        we run two udevs, one in the initramfs and one in the main OS. The
        mkswap needs to happen in the initramfs udev otherwise the udev database
        is not updated with the swap device and the zram0 device is not detected
        by systemd.

        This implementation is simpler than the one upstream and common to all
        the supported Yocto versions. It uses a udev rule in the initramfs that
        creates the swap drive, and a swap unit in the main OS that enables it.

      hash: 034ff61a58f30a980514157412c0455b52ddf744
      body: |
        When the user supplies an additional NTP server source which is a
        pool URL the 'burst' command may fail. This occurs when the pool
        URL resolves to a different IP addresses for the 'add server' and
        'burst' commands.

        To avoid this issue we can combine the burst functionality into the
        'add server' command by using the 'iburst' option. Although this
        option is not documented by the chronyc man page it has been present
        since v1.25 released in 2011.

        This fix has been tested via the balenaOS (2.51.1+rev1) command line
        running on a RPi3.

        All logging is handled by journald so remove the default dependency on
        busybox-syslog. It is still available to be explicitely included in
        images that might need it like initramfs images.

      body: >
        From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run directory in the

        root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not there.


        This commit switches to use /tmp to store the new UUID for the root partition on

        first boot after generating new UUIDs.

    - subject: Set rust 1.36 as the preferred rust version from meta-balena-common
      hash: f0217237cd3c56dcada8909af1ba871356aaff8a
      body: |
        rust is used for various utilities in the OS.
        e.g. os-config, healthdog, bindmount, some others maybe

        At the moment, we haven't syncronized on one rust version and device
        integration layers can pick any meta-rust version. Which probably uses
        the latest rust version in the layer.

        Lets sync on 1.36 and move in steps when needed.

                This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor api port` and

                is required when the host OS is doing stateful firewalling.


                This should not affect things when stateful firewalling is not in

                effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT, so we're just

                being explicit about it.

                We move the old sync.js script to tools/, and delete the now-broken

                sync-debug.js.


                We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush process

                with the supervisor on a device.

                We also remove the Makefile to go to a simpler build system, as long with

                the retry_docker_push.sh file. We remove the rest of the automation tools

                as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml file.


                We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed moving forward, and were

                only to enable livepush builds.

      body: >
        When a partition filesystem label is detected, udev checks whether the

        device belongs to the same disk as the root partitition passed in the

        kernel command line by the bootloader. Only if it does, it creates a by-state

        link to it.


        By using this by-state links we avoid filesystem label clashes as the

        system will always use partitions in the same drive as root (as

        instructed by the bootloader who is the source of truth).

        balenaOS uses FAT as a fs type for the boot/first partition. This is
        currently hardcoded so let's have the related kernel configs built in
        the kernel image. In this way we don't have to handle kernel modules in
        the initramfs (when needed).

        ppp version is 2.4.7. Without defining the right path, the path defaults

        Lets pass it here to keep it correct.

        Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with reference
        to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5 misleading
        some debug effort

        NCM mode with that specific MessageContent because that made
        other Huawei modems that used the same vid:pid combination
        unusable in that mode. So now these modems will work in the old

      hash: ea2fdb68801d62f8126bb15e8e67d0a14709dd4a
      body: |
        Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.
        e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.

        IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond this
        limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.

        We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce unnecessary
        patches in the device integration layers.

        We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

      body: >
        The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the timeout value in

        /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The default is 5

        secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS requests on

        a bandwidth sensitive channel.


        This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only applies

        when DNS servers are unresponsive so it will not affect the normal

        functionality.

      hash: 4a47b9297b37277a9aece0ea322e706dbe473f12
      body: |
        This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5 hours.

        BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to specify
        a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two number of
        seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.

        With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s (4.55h) for
        all servers.

        An architectural decision has been made not to make this configurable.

        Fixes #1780.

        It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
        is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
        internal block testing feature. This is because there is
        at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
        as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
        written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

      hash: 3004762e71383e6ed8134de526966c6dd660fca2
      body: |
        We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME
        which includes DATETIME

        DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a state
        where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.

        But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs, the
        DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have to
        run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up directories.

        Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make it
        run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with the
        most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

        Fixes #1630

        Need to make the script go in the background in ExecStartPost=.
        Otherwise, the service status never gets to active/running resulting
        it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.

        If the health-check load fails for whatever reason, the subsequent
        engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

      body: |
        Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in some
        cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot preventing
        customers from using dev images easily.

        But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps etc.

        Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable

        Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that completely
        prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

        PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there is no
        way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a result,
        when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.
        Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.

        This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is reasonable.

      body: |
        After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or user)
        can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the bootloader
        as bad reboots.

        To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the bootcount
        upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have not
        cleared their flag files in the state partition.

      body: |
        U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will require
        handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands
        env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite
        to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.

        This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.

        A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to support
        fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a device to
        not support rollback-altboot and still function.

        This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config
        options.

        We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

        config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).
        We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be enabled for
        all devices.

        This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever strange reason
        (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot reset
        command the device in 15 seconds.

        Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset command
        which it probably should.

    - subject: Add extra healthcheck to balena service. It will spin up a hello-world

      hash: 15169084fe9355e6be997712a614e383a71555c9
      body: |
        Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena daemon is
        unable to start a new container. This is usually when something in runc
        or containerd is not functioning correctly.

        Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as well.

        The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to disk
        every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if runc
        or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and systemd
        will restart the balena daemon to recover the application container

        space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when
        extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.

        The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk
        anyways.

        This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS to find
        the paths to different resources in board repository. For example
        machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release. After
        renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we support old
        references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy
        deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now with
        both cases.

        This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and will come

        In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped handling

        rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device: disable

        rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only the

        default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface will

        break connectivity if that interface is not also the default route for

        the target IP.

      body: |
        Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of the
        resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is enabled by
        default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use glibc
        and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS modules
        (libmdns).

      hash: 6500c7f020133833b820f9152c22b8e45794542c
      body: |
        This adds an easier to debug logging that shows both removed and kept
        firmwares. For example:

         Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-22.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-21.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-31.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-27.ucode.
           Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-34.ucode in place.
           Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

        Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was comparing
        strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and fallback to
        string when parse fails.

        Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly retrigger on
        change.

        Fixes #1527

        a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher specific

        Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to
        openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by 'openssl-bin'. On
        that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the uuid
        generation script fail.

        This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does that in a
        way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old provider
        (openssl package).

    - subject: Fixes for sysroot symlinks creation
      hash: b7a6412e6368d3d562ff1ca2fb06be92a24a8548
      body: |
        When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what symlinks
        to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't use
        absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses /usr/lib/udev as the
        default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.

        ```
          Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
          absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
          /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
        ```

        This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the
        resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the script
        itself.

    - subject: Make security flags inclusion yocto version specific
      hash: 9571c572e4abcd1ea5951fa408b1543bc40db8c9
      body: >
        Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based, already

        includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this version throws

        a build warning similar to:


        WARNING Duplicate inclusion for /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

        in /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


        This happens because again, we import `poky` and `security_flags` but

        since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to avoid

        this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc file at the

        level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a small

        additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from `require`

        to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this hack in

        the future.


        This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

        balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development. production
        images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.
        Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some dont.
        It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.
        e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for others.

        We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs can
        then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader config
        etc.

      hash: aa0d2154eb8aeee220807211317eafe153f46378
      body: |
        e2fsck by default checks differences between the system time and the
        last filesystem mount timestamp.

        As we run on devices without an rtc, and we run the filesystem-expand
        service which runs fsck before ntp sync happens, this results in errors
        like

        Superblock last mount time (Thu Mar 14 17:13:02 2019,
              now = Mon Mar 11 15:29:56 2019) is in the future.
        Fix? yes

        This results in fsck running on the data partition on every boot which
        slows down the boot time.

        Add e2fsck.conf file with the broken_system_clock flag to prevent this
        check from running fsck on every boot. Quite a few distros do this as
        well.

      hash: 5da7792e8c85f49fed15488ca983c1252f120d8b
      body: |
        Currently mmc and usb devices are checked at every boot for the presence
        of flasher images. USB initialization is slow 1-3 seconds. This slows
        boot time significantly.

        Most device types dont need to check for the presence of flasher images
        in usb devies. Modify u-boot to only check for mmc devices.

        usb initialization happens in devices via the "usb start" command. This
        is usually configured in CONFIG_PREBOOT for devices. Devices will need
        to remove "usb start" from CONFIG_PREBOOT to benefit from any boot time
        optimization.

        We will need to run "usb start" ourselves via env_resin for any device
        that happens to be searching for flasher images in usb device types.

        It is best to not create anything in ${B} even if just temporary because
        it alters the directory in ways which can break other parts of the build
        system. For example, if there is a leftover kernel_source.tar.gz in B,
        then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this file in
        the kernel source tree and then the command:
        tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .

        will fail like:
        tar: ./kernel/kernel_source.tar.gz: file changed as we read it

        From u-boot docs:

        We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition there is
        0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any devices
        that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook
        from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson family has
        its own custom hook with this one-liner.

      hash: 3050840935541c14ded2f9a6a1517d73dfc5ec18
      body: |
        There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a
        variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example the img
        type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't. The img
        generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the hostapp
        type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME variable which
        includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:

        IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"

        When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will fail to
        find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using the
        symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a timestamp.

    - subject: Configure NetworkManager to only ignore our vpn interface but manage
        other tun devices
      hash: 2a5415c4a9a1b9c1e3da8a340be4ba307174c42d
      body: |
        Under the current configuration we instruct NetworkManager through its
        configuration to completely ignore all the tun devices. This was
        enforced as an extra precation as we run an openvpn client which
        connects to the balena-cloud backend. This client creates, on the host,
        the interface `resin-tun` currently (rename pending). We want to loosen
        up this restriction to only unmanage this specific device - `resin-tun`
        - so that users can take advantage of NetworkManager managing other tun
        devices.

    - subject: Fix test cases for kernel module header compilation

      body: |
        For some reason, using xargs -I a produced spurious difficult to trace
        errors. Rework test case using a loop. Do the arch check using Yoctos
        QA framework that runs on all packages. Otherwise, we'd have to manually
        map various compatible arches e.g. aarch64 - arm8, 80386 - x86

        bberror does not exit the do_compile task. Add exit 1 to make sure that
        if an error is found, the task is marked as failed. Otherwise the
        error becomes a heisenbug as bitbake proceeds after do_compile.

      body: |
        63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs were
        compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the tools
        inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the native
        device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter path
        as well.

        Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.
        This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc image.

      body: |
        The bbappend uses a local `resin-files` directory for additional file
        entries but some of these files ended up in `files`. This works well if
        the recipe used is the one in the same directory as the `files`
        subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the recipe
        is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find needed
        bbappended files.

    - subject: Increase timeout for filesystem label
      hash: 9184e01e4f42b95df53f440b4638a8acd9877a9c
      body: |
        The label is actually a udev symlink, but we're keeping
        this naming to be consistent across the file.

        The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't
        able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service dependency:
        resin-partition-mounter[440]: ERROR: Timeout while waiting
        for filesystem label to appear

        By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should
        already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is
        looking for this dependency.

        The original 60s might be slow for some devices where balena

        is functioning correctly, the healthcheck will assess the
        device as unhealthy and restart balena and/or the supervisor.

      hash: c155f8edfa543d29c7efafe2fb6c80d633b82dc1
      body: |
        The current implementation checks for the existance of the `flash-boot`
        label. This breaks when after flashing the flashing device is left
        plugged. Change this with a check based on the root kernel argument.

        Fixes #1210

    - subject: "resin-vars: Implement custom ssh keys service"
      hash: 6d2e43d4693208c8df9436ea1f96c844b4faeb75
      body: >
        This patch adds support for translating SSH public keys from config.json

        to an authorize_keys file. We use `authorize_keys_local` file as the

        destination file of this translation so we can differentiate in between keys

        brought locally from config.json and keys brought from the balena backend

        through os-config an avoid racing issues with this tool (os-config). The final

        `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in the dropbear

        service.


        These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be provided

        as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

        {
          [...]
          "os": {
            "sshKeys": [
              "ssh-rsa ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
              "ssh-rsa 0123456789"
            ]
          },
          [...]
        }


        Fixes #608

      hash: 99b4e423003442a67f1fb45b1f4ae8d201c73b99
      body: |
        This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
        DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

        The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
        v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
        if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

        Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
        fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
        an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

        The update in balena adds support to pass an argument to mobynit which
        allows mobynit to mount a rootfs from a custom path.

        The command ./mobynit -sysroot /mnt/sysroot/inactive will mount the
        rootfs partition from /mnt/sysroot/inactive and return the destination
        path in stdout.

    - subject: Fix proxy when using containers over bridge network
      hash: 3df6e1906e1138a8cd10d15ac3008685b90f75f8
      body: |
        Before multicontainer support in resin, the user container was running
        over the host's network stack which means that all the packets were
        treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication was
        redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.
        In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of bridge
        network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In this case,
        the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the redirection to
        redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.
        This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets to
        redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks too.

        As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to redsocks.
        This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if the
        redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

        We would like resin-altboot service to run before balena starts
        resin-altboot checks if the boot configuration is set to run
        resinOS from rootA(B) but we are actually running rootB(A) due to
        something.

        If rollback-altboot triggers, it will run hooks to refresh boot files
        and reboot. There is no point starting balena in such a device state
        as that will only slow down the hooks from running.

      body: |
        This recipe adds a few systemd services and scripts that handle
        automated OS rollback functionality.

        The rollback-altboot.service checks if we are running in altboot mode
        i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But we are
        actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen if
        a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in resinOS_uEnv
        txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.

        The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change the
        bootfiles.

        The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if vpn is
        online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

      body: |
        This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.

        If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the
        partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env
        variables.

        To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following in
        their u-boot

        Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending on the
        device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether that
        is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.

        If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the boot
        partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"

        E.g. for rpi3
        CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y
        CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y
        CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000

      body: |
        Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra
        variables upgrade_available and resin_root_part in their grub.cfg
        files.

        Check for the presense of those variables and update them if they
        exist.

        Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg

        For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the pattern
        that exists in u-boot.
        i.e.
         Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
         Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
         upgrade_available is set
         Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
         reaches 2.

      body: |
        u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to reduce
        writes to sd card.

        If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the bootcount
        variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that u-boot
        starts counting.

        It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set
        upgrade_available=0

        For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot partition
        in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running hooks

    - subject: Pin down cargo deps (using Cargo.lock) to versions known working with
        rust 1.24.1 (for sumo)
      hash: ef3e76f2d343e8cd367214b4b5ce52b3b97be262
      body: |
        With Sumo 19.0.1, when building cargo 0.25.0 we get:
        | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module `fs`
        |   --> /yocto/resin-board/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cargo-native/
        0.25.0-r0/cargo_home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/
        libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26
        let config = fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?

        This is just one example of a package that fails like this. There are
        multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this error.

        The cargo bbclass does a:
        cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release

        This has the following effect:
        NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.
        Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`

        Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned upstream.
        In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that require a
        newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0). But at the
        same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust version.
        (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)

        The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which pins
        the packages to versions which are known to work with rust 1.24.1,
        the version we use in sumo.
