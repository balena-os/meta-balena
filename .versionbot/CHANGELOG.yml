        On transitioning from the initramfs to the rootfs, the udev database is
        cleanedup as the rules between initramfs and rootfs might defer.

        However, dm devices are flagged not to be re-processed, so we need to
        set a sticky bit on them so they persist the cleanup.

      hash: 449dee77f54d4185f98854bca9148a6f42620bc8
      body: >
        From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run directory in the

        root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not

        there.


        Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use /tmp

        to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

        generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


        However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is recreated

        on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems for DM

        devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not
        re-processed

        by udevd.


        This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may
        implement

        disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains backwards

        compatible for HUP from older releases.

        Some BSPs name the u-boot such as u-boot-imx_2020 for example.
        Because of that, our existing bbappend called u-boot_%.bbappend
        will not match it and will fail to be applied.
        This PR is a first pass at solving this by moving at least the
        SRC_URI appending part from this bbappend and into the
        resin-u-boot.bbclass instead. Further investigation is needed
        to see if we can remove this bbappend altogether since we may
        have all boards using Poky Warrior or newer, making this
        u-boot bbappend obsolete.

        anymore therefore we can safely remove it.

        The original file should already be deployed, we only need to add

        This patch replaces the kernel being shipped with the one that we
        eventually

        sign for EFI - without signing the original file used would be identical

        but after applying signature, the signed version is the one we want to
        ship.


        It also fixes the file name for the detached signature, which must match

        the name of the associated file.

    - subject: 'systemd/timeinit: add HTTPS time synchronisation service'
      hash: 2bb18707557979ed6466f45602de4ecf5b386c57
      body: |
        Add a new timesync-https systemd service to synchronise the system
        time at boot using an HTTPS header. The service uses curl to request
        an HTTPS header from either $API_ENDPOINT/connectivity-check (default)
        or the URL defined by the os.network.connectivity.uri field in
        config.json. The URL used *must* return HTTP code 204 (No Content)
        in response to a request so that we can determine that we have full
        network connectivity and are not operating behind a captive portal.

        The date field returned by a valid header is used to set the current
        system time. The date/time derived from the header is assumed to be a
        reasonable source of 'truth' such that it can be used to adjust the
        system time both backwards and forwards. This will compensate for any
        erroneous timestamps saved via fake-hwclock or any invalid data
        read from an RTC.

        The service will exit when a valid response has been received. Poll
        attempts will be made at an increasing interval starting at 2s and
        doubling up to a maximum of 64s. Polling will continue at the maximum
        interval until a valid response has been received.

        This service will provide initial time synchronisation for devices
        where NTP ports have been blocked. For devices where NTP access is
        available it should ensure that any system 'time jump' is only a few
        seconds when NTP synchronisation is eventually achieved. It also
        allows other services to start with a reasonably accurate time
        without having to wait for the NTP synchronisation process to
        complete.

        Services that are ordered after the new time-sync-https-wait target
        can be sure that full network connectivity has been achieved and that
        time has been synchronised with an accuracy of a few seconds.

        The interface test uses a simple ping to ensure a specific interface

        test while not adding anything of value.

        Reduce the timeout to the minimum non-privileged interval of 2ms.

        GRUB can not use the TPM easily to unlock the volumes and find the

        on an encrypted partition. Instead, we choose to store a linux kernel

        and use it as 2nd stage bootloader to unlock the partition, load the
        actual

        kernel and kexec into it. This should eventually be replaced by a proper

        2nd stage bootloader that is being worked on.

        Currently the two classes would keep the original files untouched and
        store

        the signed versions as .signed. This patch reverses the logic - the
        signed

        files replace the original ones and the unsigned version is stored as
        .unsigned.

        This is because there is no real use-case for the unsigned files, we
        always

        want to ship the signed version, even if the particular DT does not
        require it,

        this causes no harm.

      hash: 07dbe414a1dfa556427d4fc94ce7fdec688cf0e2
      body: |
        Previously, the core service exposed a /proxy endpoint that would start
        up a proxy remotely, which would be used by a test in the connectivity
        module. However, the endpoint returned the address for the testbot to be
        used as the proxy in the response, and this required manual
        configuration of the interface. Additionally, it requires the worker
        service to install and provide glider for forward proxying.

        Move the proxy (glider) to a container on the device being tested,
        which simplifies configuration, and reduces the complexity and size of
        the interface of Leviathan.

        Add a test to wait for the chronyd service to become active before
        starting the time sync tests.

        The current chronyd tests assume that the chronyd service is
        instantly available at boot time. With the addition of the new
        HTTPS time synchronisation service the starting of chronyd can be
        delayed by a few seconds so we need to ensure that the service
        is actually running before proceeding.

      hash: 7dde2133a5b1df710255b8b0471385cca1449c1d
      body: >
        When user namespacing was enabled in the kernel by default, a separate

        commit [0] was introduced to disable the feature at runtime, to allow

        users/administrators to explicitly choose to enable it, avoiding

        potential security implications.


        However, some applications such as Chromium's sandbox, require either

        SUID or user namespacing to work. Disabling this feature on boards

        that previously enabled it necessitates container modifications and

        potentially breaks previously working applications.


        Create a distro feature to disable user namespacing by default in

        meta-balena, while allowing device types to keep it enabled to maintain

        compatibility with their original behavior.

        This avoids the kernel printing debug messages on the consoles. It is
        also the default in other upstream distros like Ubuntu.

      body: |
        At runtime we can now enable development features that were previously
        configured using the development-image feature. That feature also
        configured U-Boot for OS development.

        Now we have two distinct functionalities:

        * A runtime development configuration variable that configures the
        device to facilitate application development
        * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for BSP and OS
        development

        This allows us to merge the current production/development images into
        a single image.

        the new OS anymore. This is necessary only when updating from older
        OS versions in which the supervisor adds the isolcpus
        setting to the boot partition extlinux.conf file.

                as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by
                the

                dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.


                This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the
                supervisor

                journal logs as


                ```

                getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                    at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                ```


                Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the
                mangled image

                name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to
                remove the

                supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting
                the

                database should be side effect free.

                make environment

                known identifiers

                for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction by
                removing some of those

                - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future release_uuid)


                This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it doesn't
                completely get rid of

                these identifiers (which are still being used by supervisor API
                and for state

                patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for calculating
                steps to target state.

              hash: f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19
              body: >
                The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker IDs as
                the main

                way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if the
                target

                state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the supervisor
                will always use

                the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to tag the
                image on

                the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to ensure

                consistency is maintained between the database and the engine.


                Using tags allows to simplify query and removal operations,
                since now

                removing the image now means removing tags matching the image
                name.


                Before this change the supervisor relied only on information in
                the

                supervisor database, and used that to remove images by docker
                ID. However, the docker

                id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the same id
                between

                releases or between services in the same release.

                The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex instance
                from the

                db module but that was leading to issues when running tests
                using `test:fast`.

                This provides a fix for the test module that just removes the
                destroy

                call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

        Change the NetworkManager NTP dispatcher script to update the

        Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any
        network interface. It makes more sense to run it for
        'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in whether
        the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is
        up or down.

      hash: 31c3ae8ad5c7ad45e450349b6972524da120e96c
      body: |
        Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing enabled
        in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and Ubuntu,
        default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user
        namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in the
        kernel.

        Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more conservative,
        disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian
        maintains its own patch to add the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone
        tunable.

        The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of application
        developers not using this feature due to it being generally unavailable
        in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.

        RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max number of
        user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but without
        an out of tree patch.

        Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as RHEL, in
        the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have chosen.

        596b0474d3d9b1242eab713f84d8873f9887d980 for details.

        Hence we use in meta-balena-dunfell the upstream kernel-devsrc from the
        hardknott-3.3.1 Poky release which handles this module.lds move.

              body: >
                This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads after
                failures with

                the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases
                involving

                large layers and unreliable network connections.


                These are the changes:


                * Make sure we also retry after failures in
                `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                  This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                  and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of
                retrying
                  immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                  network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything
                at all.
                  The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                  continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                  strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                  will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

        This avoids a compile error on kernel 5.10.31 on arm64
        raspberrypicm4-ioboard for example where it would complain _mcount is
        undefined because the older gcc in the intel-nuc-debian:stretch-20190717
        base image would not create the _mcount symbol when compiling against
        the newer 5.10.31 kernel.

        resolves to the production image. We manually resolve the version to fix
        this.

        Replace the IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE magic number with a calculation based on
        the partition sizes on the balena image classes.

        The rootfs size is calculated with the assumption of a total BalenaOS
        size of 700M. This includes boot, state, rootA and rootB partitions. The
        data partition will then grow to occupy the rest of the storage media.

        Device integration layers can override this value if needed.

      hash: a6781d54c6edced457ad916cac3fec9c70d25a0a
      body: |
        Add a new systemd service to check for full network connectivity.
        This service is required because the default NetworkManager (NM)
        connectivity checker doesn't differentiate between the
        CONNECTED_LOCAL, CONNECTED_SITE and CONNECTED_GLOBAL states. This
        service checks for the CONNECTED_GLOBAL state only and can be used
        to delay the start of other services which require full network
        access to be available. This can help to avoid startup problems on
        networks with slow DNS access or that utilise a captive portal.

        The script does an initial oneshot check of the NM state to make sure
        that we don't wait for an event that doesn't come. This check is
        redundant at boot time due to the fact that the service is started
        before NM to ensure that no NM DBus events are missed. The initial
        check is useful in circumstances where you want to run the script
        standalone or post-boot.

        Other services that wish to make use of this service and wait for
        full network connectivity should add the following entries to their
        systemd unit definition:

        Requires=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target
        After=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

        This makes it easier to overwrite the arguments passed in the engine

        unit from drop-in overwrites. See the development image drop-in unit for

        reference.


        Using `systemctl edit --runtime balena.service`, which puts those

        overwrites into `/run/systemd/system/balena.service.d/`, it would be

        possible to modify the runtime behavior of the engine without remounting

        the rootfs to be writeable.

      hash: d965d23fe60db6254eaabd81a0d48b5718e01a3a
      body: |
        The hostapp-update hooks would run before the supervisor update step
        when using balenahup via the dashboard. This resulted in the balena
        supervisor state conf file being out-of-date.

        This commit removes the hostapp-update hook and instead uses a
        oneshot service to ensure the conf is migrated if it does not exist
        in the new path before starting the supervisor.

      hash: ac0ba89f14c0b04b7353192f15a0634be44d910c
      body: >
        Some BSPs have enabled CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC which

        can trigger panics upon high iowait, such as balena-engine

        downloading/writing a large image to disk.


        Kconfig says the following:

            Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on "hung tasks",
            which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck
            in uninterruptible "D" state.

            The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
            to cause the system to reboot automatically after a
            hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for
            high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and
            where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.

            Say N if unsure.

        Hung tasks are not normally terminal, nor do they affect system

        stability, but panicking during an image write forces a device into a

        bootloop that requires manual intervention to remedy.


        See the below stacktrace:

        balena-engine hasn't transitioned to building with modules yet, and Go
        1.16 enabled them by default. Revert to the old behavior for now to fix
          the build.

        This option will be removed in Go 1.17, so we'll have to update our
        build before upgrading further.

      hash: 61280e84e045a4b235a21eec194fc8cf894c310d
      body: |
        Improve the handling of the os.network.* parameters defined in
        config.json.

        The balena-config-vars script has been updated to process the
        os.network.* parameters from config.json. This allows scripts
        to access these parameters by just including balena-config-vars
        rather than having to parse them directly. Some of the default
        settings have now been included as part of the jq parsing string.
        The jq command has also been assigned to an interim variable rather
        than being evaluated directly. This allows other scripts which
        include balena-config-vars to handle parsing errors correctly when
        they are running with 'set -e'.

        The os-networkmanager script has been updated to make use of the
        balena-config-vars script and no longer parses config.json itself.
        The logging has been standardised and the simplification of the
        variable processing has reduced the size of the script from 146
        to 101 lines.

        The build time tests have been removed as the os-networkmanager script
        is unable to access /usr/sbin/balena-config-vars at buildtime.

              hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a
              body: >
                A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam config,

                checking that both network and subnet are defined for each ipam
                config entry

                (as described in the docker documentation).


                After that PR, the validations throws an exception if the
                network target state is incorrect,

                but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because that
                exception is also triggered

                when querying target state.


                This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in local
                mode, because local

                mode queries the old target state before sending a new one.
                Since the query fails,

                the CLI can never push the new target state.


                This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the logs, since
                a

                misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures, it will
                just

                prevent containers to communicate through the provided network.


                A future improvement should move this validation to an earlier
                point in the process,

                so the target state can get rejected before it even gets to a
                point it

                can be used.

                The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version no

                SUPERVISOR_TAG environment variable setup on supervisor.conf and

                update-supervisor.conf.


                This change removes the need for that variable with livepush
                supervisor

                to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

                'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
                and util.promisify for faster native methods.
                'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                contained within express v4.x.

        This brings in the aufs-to-overlay migrator. Which won't run until we
        configure the engine service to include an `BALENA_MIGRATE_OVERLAY=1`
        env var.

        The other notable change is the fix for
        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/236 which allows
        `balena top` to work as expected on balenaOS

      hash: 9de54188ea47e121a7f408ae1c65f70f53d3a634
      body: |
        We need to make sure the modem is completely initialized before sending
        the AT commands that do the switch to ECM mode. To achieve this we
        change the systemd service dependency to depend on ModemManager.service
        and then we determine the modem state by using mmcli and querying the
        modem power-state property.

        This procedure will only be done once. After the modem is placed in ECM
        mode, it will stay in this mode for future reboots so there will be no
        other delays in bringing up the modem connection.

    - subject: 'resin-mounts/etc-fake-hwclock: add dependency on resin-state services'
      hash: 2b07011844a2738aec033d88af29e3f6e0dd28a2
      body: |
        Added a dependency on resin-state.service and resin-state-reset.service
        to etc-fake-hwclock.mount.

        On initial boot after flashing a device the resin-state-reset.service
        was running after etc-fake-hwclock.mount causing the bind mount point
        /mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/fake-hwclock to be deleted after it had
        been mounted. This resulted in a failure to save the date/time at
        shutdown which caused problems with persistent logging at next boot.
        Subsequent boots are unaffected as resin-state-reset does not run.
        Adding a dependency on the resin-state services ensures that the
        bind mount point is created after the state reset has been performed.

        This issue was noticed when running the testbot unmanaged OS image
        persistent logging test. When running a managed OS image the device
        normally reboots fairly immediately after connecting to the
        balena-cloud host and receiving parameter updates, so this issue is
        not usually noticeable.

        the udev rule to skip such devices and only trigger on add or change
        events.

      hash: 7983e9bfd716aaedad1ef5f1468b2771e1f5a71c
      body: |
        Previously we were loading the healthcheck image from it's own service
        that was previously made `PartOf=` the balena.service.
        This was done in an attempt to help get the system unstuck when the
        image is removed (like through manual pruning), which would cause the
        healthcheck to trigger the engine to reboot until the load service was
        restarted by hand.

        Further investigation found a race between the first execution of the
        engine healthcheck script (which needs the image to be loaded) and the
        loader service itself, which would lead to a similar state, requireing
        manual intervention.

        This change moves the loading into the healthcheck script itself,
        allowing us to remove the loader script and service entirely, skipping
        the whole service ordering issue.

    - subject: 'grub-efi: build required modules into grub image'
      hash: 5e1004d6753025166c40b11af117e008feb875f1
      body: |
        grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition, and
        resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.

        A normal grub installation installs those modules to ${PREFIX}/${libdir}
        to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're building the
        image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.

        The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these
        constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to
        ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This had the
        unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases, such as
        clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps of the
        build.

        Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append the
        required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub image
        without any external modules at all.

        If the device with flasher rootfs is slow to bring up and rootfs is
        defined

        as UUID=xxx the waiting loop in rootfs initrd script would assume UUIDs
        have

        just been regenerated and wait for a by-state symlink instead. This only
        works

        for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated UUIDs

        therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

      body: |
        Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount
        unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).

        Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock directory
        results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the same
        directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods try to
        unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory being
        unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save the
        system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time
        at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

        Update the existing DHCP dispatcher script for adding NTP sources to
        make use of dynamic chrony source configuration. Any DHCP configured

        network 'up' or DHCP lease renewal events. Any DHCP configured NTP
        sources for a particular interface are deleted on network 'down'
        events. Changes to the sources file are picked up by chrony either
        when it starts up or at runtime using the chrony-helper script.

        Add a dispatcher script to trigger the chrony online/offline
        status on network 'up' and 'down' events. This will make chrony
        re-run an iburst for sources when the appropriate network interface
        comes back up.

        Fixes #2075


        Needed were a number of various changes to make the package compile
        properly:


        Removed is 0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch
        that is now

        included upstream.


        Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is reworked
        for ease of

        maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to debug level.


        Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a wrong
        version number.


        The following additional configuration options were added/removed:


        *. Introspection is disabled through `--enable-introspection=no`. Other
        services do

        not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is no
        longer needed

        0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


        *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is disabled as
        we do not

        use firewalld.


        *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so
        `--enable-polkit-agent` and

        `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

      hash: 00556af37cf241e2b95d9b719f1ab58cc9bbddb6
      body: >
        Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

        any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

        from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


        By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

        such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of this

        when compiled in "desktop" mode.


        This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary into

        a separate procps package:


        -
        https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90


        So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into compat
        branches

        and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than gatesgarth.

    - subject: Fix pppd timeout when launched by NetworkManager
      hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c
      body: |
        Fixes #1846

        UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under
        balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to establish
        ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.

        This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to `/etc/ppp/options`
        to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.

        The connect option specifies an external script to establish the
        physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is
        ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing it
        to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

        However, the API expects this parameter to be unset completely if
        there's no version to be reported during registration, otherwise
        the call fails and the device doesn't show up in dashboard during
        flashing or report the post-provisioning state.

        version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
        as well.

        - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
          as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
        - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.

    - subject: 'start-resin-supervisor: fix directory creation for ''balena start'''
      hash: ce9e4f211a2356a866edee5ca3dbada3faa27689
      body: |
        Ensure that the /var/log/supervisor-log directory exists prior to
        running 'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' as well as
        'runSupervisor'.

        Updates to the 'start-resin-supervisor' script in v2.62.1 removed
        the check for updates to the REGISTRY_ENDPOINT variable. Previously
        this had been detected as changing every time the script was run
        due to a comparison between 'null' and ''. This resulted in the
        'start-resin-supervisor' script always running through the
        'runSupervisor' path. With this variable check removed, and no config
        updates being detected, the script was trying to run
        'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' and failing due to the
        absence of the /var/log/supervisor-log directory. To fix this problem we
        unconditionally test for and create this directory (if necessary) so
        that it is available regardless of the path taken through the script.

      hash: 447449808ef08577712db43b1042599ad4d7d23c
      body: |
        Change the chrony UDP source port from 123 (privileged) to
        1234 (non-privileged).

        Previous issues with Phicomm routers had required the use of a fixed
        UDP source port, so port 123 was chosen as this is used by both ntpd
        and ntpdate. However recent testing has shown that using a privileged
        port such as 123 can cause issues on other networks. By changing the
        port to be non-privileged (i.e. 1234) we can satisfy both network
        requirements.

      hash: 1c1374f3c8b5914b7e645f8068ebafc8b4cbbe3a
      body: |
        The handling of the RTC at boot time has been improved as follows:

        1) A 'timeinit-rtc.sh' script has been added to improve logging of
           system time updates from the RTC and to prevent system time
           being set when RTC time is behind system time. If RTC time is
           found to be behind system time a warning is issued regarding
           potential RTC battery failure.

        2) The 'timeinit-rtc.service' has been added to the new systemd
           'time-set.target'. This allows for better control and
           co-ordination between the various time source services.

        3) Systemd dependencies have been updated to ensure that the
           RTC is the final time service before the 'time-set.target'
           is reached.

        The 'timeinit-buildtime.sh' script has been updated to use the
        new support functions provided by the 'os-helpers-time' script.

                A docker-compose.yml with the following structure


                ```

                version: '2.1'

                services:
                  app_1:
                    build: ./noisy-1
                    image: noisy1
                  app_2:
                    build: ./noisy-1

                    image: noisy1
                ```


                Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image database
                entries

                with the same dockerId (this is because of how the engine
                handles this

                particular case). This case is not handled by the removal
                process

                leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

                The memory information reported by the supervisor currently

                estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal - MemFree`.

                However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as much

                memory as possible, which will affect the output of `MemFree`

                (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage seen

                by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much greater
                than

                it is.


                The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree - Buffers
                - Cached`,

                which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free`
                commands.

                from this env var since it requires a container restart any time
                the supervisor

                gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See #1465


                This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration, which lead

                the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when no
                change was

                needed.

                Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor API, will

                now get an individual key which can be scoped to specific
                resources.

                In this iteration the default scope will be to the application
                that

                the service belongs to.


                We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud API
                when in

                managed mode.

      hash: 6b95bd55f12054d996a412e7a6bc202e518b4e29
      body: |
        By default chrony uses a random UDP source port for each NTP request.
        This can cause problems with particular routers/firewalls (issues have
        been reported for the Phicomm KE 2P).

        The chrony `acquisitionport` configuration setting has been added
        to the chrony.conf file to change the UDP source port for NTP requests
        to 123 (this is the same as the default source port used by both
        ntpdate and ntpd).

      body: |
        Drop the '-s' command line parameter from chronyd as:
        a) restoring time from the drift file is no longer necessary due to
        the fake-hwclock service, and
        b) restoring time from the RTC is already covered by the timeinit-rtc
        service.

      hash: 96c2c495819ba6175261a5179e1cdb4673552e6c
      body: |
        In order to produce sensible timestamps for journald log messages:
        a) the system time needs to be maintained correctly over a reboot, and
        b) the system time needs to be set before journald is started.

        Currently the system time is maintained over reboots on systems
        without an RTC using the last modified time of the chrony drift file.
        However there are a couple of issues with this approach:

        a) /var/lib/chrony/ is not mounted early enough in the boot process
        to be available for setting the time before journald is started.
        b) there is an issue with the current systemd dependencies that result
        in the last modified time of the drift file not being updated when the
        system is shutdown or rebooted (see #1995).

        The Debian fake-hwclock service (as used by Raspberry Pi OS) has been
        added to overcome these issues.

        The fake-hwclock service will save and restore the system time from
        the fake-hwclock.data file (in /etc/fake-hwclock/). The system time
        is loaded from this file at boot and saved to it on shutdown. An
        additional timer service has been added to update the file on an
        hourly basis to cater for unexpected shutdown scenarios, e.g. power
        failure.

        The timeinit-timestamp service has improved logging and has been
        renamed to timeinit-buildtime for clarity.

        A new time-set.target has been added as per upstream systemd and
        the fake-hwclock and timeinit-buildtime services have been added
        to it.

      hash: 494eeb4a699b4dd5e48547d6e5e45cffb7bf0720
      body: |
        If the rootfs is on a slow-to-bring-up device (e.g. RPi4 + USB)
        the fsuuidsinit_enabled() function may return before the balena symlinks
        are created. This gets wrongly interpreted as missing UUIDs leading to
        a chain of failures in the subsequent scripts.
        This patch moves the symlink waiting loop from fsuuidsinit_run()
        to fsuuids_enabled() before the first usage of the symlink.

    - subject: Respect balenaRootCA system-wide
      hash: 2218cb21d1fc813ac59c08b77046c5d014ad9a42
      body: |
        We allow the user to specify a custom CA in the .balenaRootCA key
        of config.json but at this moment each tool has to implement support
        if it wants to use it. This commit adds it to the system-wide CA bundle
        so that the CA is respected everywhere.

        Fixes #1398

        This is where the logs and error messages should go by default
        as they are not part of the tool's output.

                Due to switching to Alpine the ability to resolve mDNS

                manually resolves the names.

                                get to the bottom of it.

                                It will impact performance, but right now there
                                are things that should

                                be filtered and are not, so lets get this merged

                        Handlebars supports very basic if condition checking,
                        but it only checks for

                        existence of a field. There are times when we want to
                        combine conditions in order

                        to generate something as part of a blueprint, without
                        defining a completely separate

                        blueprint for it (like generating network config schema
                        if a dt has a wifi chip or

                        a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

        images report their preconfigured supervisor version without a good
        understanding of how flasher images work. As it turns out no supervisor
        information is maintained in the flasher image itself, so until that is
        sorted stop reporting a blank string for the supervisor version.

        supervisor: allow supervisor updates without controlling the supervisor
        state
      hash: 6208f065e59d9c15e10e872bff788c0b80020983
      body: >
        Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files
        underneath it will change during runtime.

        OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor reboots
        the device during a HUP,

        which in turn bricks the device.


        Additionally, since unknown args cause this update to fail-closed,

        remove that barrier to future-proof more flag expansion.

      body: |
        On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the supervisor moved
        from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit creation of
        directories instead of files.

        However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory, these have
        to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create them.

        This commit checks for the existence of the /var/log/supervisor-log
        directory and creates it if required.

        In rocko, systemd kills any script started in background,
        same thing happening to children that get re-parented.

        One solution to this is to use a separate service file for
        starting the healtcheck image load script, after balena.service
        was started.

        Otherwise, as util-linux has a higher default alternative priority, the

        version in util-linux is chosen. It would seem they are exchangeable,

        the busybox version reportedly works even if the RTC interrupt line is
        not

        connected.

      hash: a93bd242d37246da83c1fa4368174d89b5c045f4
      body: |
        On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the supervisor moved
        from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit creation of
        directories instead of files.

        However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory, these have
        to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create them.

        This commit checks for the existence of the /resin-data/resin-supervisor
        directory and creates it if required.

        When performing hostOS updates, the resin-logo.png might have
        been customized by the customer.
        This commits renames it to the newly branded balena-logo.png

        If the resin-logo.png was unmodified, it will forcefully replace to
        balena-logo.png to force rebranding of older resin branded release.

        Fixes #1801

        The `docker` Docker Hub repository lists what versions of the image

        are supported and 18.6 is not among them at all. Use the current stable

        line of 18.09 instead, to stay on supported versions. See more info at:

        https://hub.docker.com/_/docker


        For more reproducability, we are also including the patch level version

        of the container, which will give us more responsibility to update more

        frequently, but fewer surprises.


        Also explicitly set `DOCKER_HOST` for the daemon being started,
        otherwise

        the base image's setting might silently take over, and modify this.


        Replace deprecated `-g` (graph driver) with `--data-root` as well.

      hash: 7826c8ba9a9b6a97021fbcd352f627518afa8d73
      body: |
        resin-init has a hardcoded command to disable power management
        on wlan0. This commit moves the logic to udev rule as there is
        no guarantee wlan0 is the only or default wlan adapter in the system.

        There seems to be no better way to identify a wlan device in udev
        than KERNEL=="wl*" which should match both net.ifnames=0 (wlanX)
        and net.ifnames=1 (wlpX).

                In the absence of an upstream implementation of the
                DeviceRequest API introduced

                as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a feature
                label.


                As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the default
                behavior of

                docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the `gpu`
                capabilty.

                The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA driver;
                here:

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go

                We were treating the database class as a singleton, but still
                having to pass

                around the db instance. Now we can simply require the db module
                and have

                access to the database handle.

      body: |
        This enables a compressed RAM swap of 25% of total system memory or 1GB,
        whichever smallest.

        Upstream Yocto has a zram implementation that's broken in warrior, and a
        new implementation introduced in Zeus that does not work in BalenaOS as
        we run two udevs, one in the initramfs and one in the main OS. The
        mkswap needs to happen in the initramfs udev otherwise the udev database
        is not updated with the swap device and the zram0 device is not detected
        by systemd.

        This implementation is simpler than the one upstream and common to all
        the supported Yocto versions. It uses a udev rule in the initramfs that
        creates the swap drive, and a swap unit in the main OS that enables it.

    - subject: 'resin-ntp-config: merge ''burst'' command with ''add server'' line'
      hash: 034ff61a58f30a980514157412c0455b52ddf744
      body: |
        When the user supplies an additional NTP server source which is a
        pool URL the 'burst' command may fail. This occurs when the pool
        URL resolves to a different IP addresses for the 'add server' and
        'burst' commands.

        To avoid this issue we can combine the burst functionality into the
        'add server' command by using the 'iburst' option. Although this
        option is not documented by the chronyc man page it has been present
        since v1.25 released in 2011.

        This fix has been tested via the balenaOS (2.51.1+rev1) command line
        running on a RPi3.

      hash: bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2
      body: >
        From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run directory in the

        root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not
        there.


        This commit switches to use /tmp to store the new UUID for the root
        partition on

        first boot after generating new UUIDs.

    - subject: Set rust 1.36 as the preferred rust version from meta-balena-common
      hash: f0217237cd3c56dcada8909af1ba871356aaff8a
      body: |
        rust is used for various utilities in the OS.
        e.g. os-config, healthdog, bindmount, some others maybe

        At the moment, we haven't syncronized on one rust version and device
        integration layers can pick any meta-rust version. Which probably uses
        the latest rust version in the layer.

        Lets sync on 1.36 and move in steps when needed.

                This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor api
                port` and

                is required when the host OS is doing stateful firewalling.


                This should not affect things when stateful firewalling is not
                in

                effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT, so we're
                just

                being explicit about it.

                We move the old sync.js script to tools/, and delete the
                now-broken

                sync-debug.js.


                We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush process

                with the supervisor on a device.

                automation tools

                as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml file.


                We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed moving
                forward, and were

                only to enable livepush builds.

                This change makes sure we are cycling until a random sequence is

    - subject: Create udev state symlinks for all partitions
      hash: b7f63b18bcebf663d4d4d366dc78abe08c15925d
      body: >
        When a partition filesystem label is detected, udev checks whether the

        device belongs to the same disk as the root partitition passed in the

        kernel command line by the bootloader. Only if it does, it creates a
        by-state

        link to it.


        By using this by-state links we avoid filesystem label clashes as the

        system will always use partitions in the same drive as root (as

        instructed by the bootloader who is the source of truth).

      body: |
        balenaOS uses FAT as a fs type for the boot/first partition. This is
        currently hardcoded so let's have the related kernel configs built in
        the kernel image. In this way we don't have to handle kernel modules in
        the initramfs (when needed).

                semver, which allows us to always match using comparison

                as < and <=.

        Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with reference
        to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5 misleading

        No user impact. Increase limit for maximum initramfs size from 12MB to

        Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.
        e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.

        IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond this
        limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.

        We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce unnecessary
        patches in the device integration layers.

        We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

    - subject: Increase DNS clients timeout to 15 seconds
      hash: b4122eeea971dfc9325885cc7c896c733cf60920
      body: >
        The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the timeout value
        in

        /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The default is 5

        secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS requests on

        a bandwidth sensitive channel.


        This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only applies

        when DNS servers are unresponsive so it will not affect the normal

        functionality.


        Fixes #1800

      hash: 4a47b9297b37277a9aece0ea322e706dbe473f12
      body: |
        This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5 hours.

        BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to specify
        a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two number of
        seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.

        With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s (4.55h) for
        all servers.

        An architectural decision has been made not to make this configurable.

        Fixes #1780.

        It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
        is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
        internal block testing feature. This is because there is
        at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
        as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
        written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

      hash: 3004762e71383e6ed8134de526966c6dd660fca2
      body: |
        We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME
        which includes DATETIME

        DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a state
        where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.

        But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs, the
        DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have to
        run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up directories.

        Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make it
        run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with the
        most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

        Make uboot dev images autoboot delay build time configurable. Default is

      body: |
        Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in some
        cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot preventing
        customers from using dev images easily.

        But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps etc.

        Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable

        Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that completely
        prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

        PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there is no
        way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a result,
        when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.
        Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.

        This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is reasonable.

      body: |
        After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or user)
        can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the bootloader
        as bad reboots.

        To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the bootcount
        upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have not
        cleared their flag files in the state partition.

      body: |
        U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will require
        handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands
        env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite
        to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.

        This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.

        A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to support
        fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a device to
        not support rollback-altboot and still function.

        This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config
        options.

        We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

        We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be enabled for
        all devices.

        This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever strange reason
        (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot reset
        command the device in 15 seconds.

        Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset command
        which it probably should.

        ExecStartPost should run after the daemon is initialized but chaining a
        15 second sleep for good measure.

        We load the hello-world image here so that devices out in the field and
        on prem devices don't need to pull from dockerhub which would require
        external internet connectivity.

        Add extra healthcheck to balena service. It will spin up a hello-world
        container as well
      hash: 15169084fe9355e6be997712a614e383a71555c9
      body: |
        Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena daemon is
        unable to start a new container. This is usually when something in runc
        or containerd is not functioning correctly.

        Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as well.

        The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to disk
        every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if runc
        or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and systemd
        will restart the balena daemon to recover the application container

        The data partition contains the supervisor which is only about 61M on

        zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat less
        space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when
        extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.

        The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk
        anyways.

        This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS to find
        the paths to different resources in board repository. For example
        machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release. After
        renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we support old
        references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy
        deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now with
        both cases.

        This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and will come

        included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


        In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped handling

        rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device: disable

        rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only the

        default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface will

        break connectivity if that interface is not also the default route for

        the target IP.

      body: |
        Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of the
        resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is enabled by
        default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use glibc
        and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS modules
        (libmdns).

    - subject: Improve logging and version comparison in linux-firmware cleanup class
      hash: 6500c7f020133833b820f9152c22b8e45794542c
      body: |
        This adds an easier to debug logging that shows both removed and kept
        firmwares. For example:

         Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-22.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-21.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-31.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode.
           Removing iwlwifi-8000C-27.ucode.
           Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-34.ucode in place.
           Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

        Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was comparing
        strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and fallback to
        string when parse fails.

        Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly retrigger on
        change.

        Fixes #1527

        a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher specific

      body: |
        Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to
        openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by 'openssl-bin'. On
        that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the uuid
        generation script fail.

        This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does that in a
        way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old provider
        (openssl package).

    - subject: Fixes for sysroot symlinks creation
      hash: b7a6412e6368d3d562ff1ca2fb06be92a24a8548
      body: |
        When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what symlinks
        to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't use
        absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses /usr/lib/udev as the
        default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.

        ```
          Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
          absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
          /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
        ```

        This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the
        resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the script
        itself.

    - subject: Make security flags inclusion yocto version specific
      hash: 9571c572e4abcd1ea5951fa408b1543bc40db8c9
      body: >
        Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based, already

        includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this version throws

        a build warning similar to:


        WARNING Duplicate inclusion for
        /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

        in
        /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


        This happens because again, we import `poky` and `security_flags` but

        since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to avoid

        this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc file at the

        level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a small

        additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from `require`

        to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this hack in

        the future.


        This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

      body: |
        balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development. production
        images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.
        Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some dont.
        It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.
        e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for others.

        We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs can
        then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader config
        etc.

        Fix bug where fsck was run on the data partition on every boot even if
        it wasn't needed due to old system time.
      hash: aa0d2154eb8aeee220807211317eafe153f46378
      body: |
        e2fsck by default checks differences between the system time and the
        last filesystem mount timestamp.

        As we run on devices without an rtc, and we run the filesystem-expand
        service which runs fsck before ntp sync happens, this results in errors
        like

        Superblock last mount time (Thu Mar 14 17:13:02 2019,
              now = Mon Mar 11 15:29:56 2019) is in the future.
        Fix? yes

        This results in fsck running on the data partition on every boot which
        slows down the boot time.

        Add e2fsck.conf file with the broken_system_clock flag to prevent this
        check from running fsck on every boot. Quite a few distros do this as
        well.

      hash: 5da7792e8c85f49fed15488ca983c1252f120d8b
      body: |
        Currently mmc and usb devices are checked at every boot for the presence
        of flasher images. USB initialization is slow 1-3 seconds. This slows
        boot time significantly.

        Most device types dont need to check for the presence of flasher images
        in usb devies. Modify u-boot to only check for mmc devices.

        usb initialization happens in devices via the "usb start" command. This
        is usually configured in CONFIG_PREBOOT for devices. Devices will need
        to remove "usb start" from CONFIG_PREBOOT to benefit from any boot time
        optimization.

        We will need to run "usb start" ourselves via env_resin for any device
        that happens to be searching for flasher images in usb device types.

        It is best to not create anything in ${B} even if just temporary because
        it alters the directory in ways which can break other parts of the build
        system. For example, if there is a leftover kernel_source.tar.gz in B,
        then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this file in
        the kernel source tree and then the command:
        tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .

        will fail like:
        tar: ./kernel/kernel_source.tar.gz: file changed as we read it

        From u-boot docs:

        input format"

        We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition there is
        0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any devices
        that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook
        from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson family has
        its own custom hook with this one-liner.

      hash: 3050840935541c14ded2f9a6a1517d73dfc5ec18
      body: |
        There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a
        variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example the img
        type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't. The img
        generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the hostapp
        type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME variable which
        includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:

        IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"

        When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will fail to
        find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using the
        symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a timestamp.

      body: |
        Under the current configuration we instruct NetworkManager through its
        configuration to completely ignore all the tun devices. This was
        enforced as an extra precation as we run an openvpn client which
        connects to the balena-cloud backend. This client creates, on the host,
        the interface `resin-tun` currently (rename pending). We want to loosen
        up this restriction to only unmanage this specific device - `resin-tun`
        - so that users can take advantage of NetworkManager managing other tun
        devices.

      body: |
        For some reason, using xargs -I a produced spurious difficult to trace
        errors. Rework test case using a loop. Do the arch check using Yoctos
        QA framework that runs on all packages. Otherwise, we'd have to manually
        map various compatible arches e.g. aarch64 - arm8, 80386 - x86

        bberror does not exit the do_compile task. Add exit 1 to make sure that
        if an error is found, the task is marked as failed. Otherwise the
        error becomes a heisenbug as bitbake proceeds after do_compile.

      body: |
        63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs were
        compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the tools
        inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the native
        device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter path
        as well.

        Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.
        This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc image.

      body: |
        The bbappend uses a local `resin-files` directory for additional file
        entries but some of these files ended up in `files`. This works well if
        the recipe used is the one in the same directory as the `files`
        subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the recipe
        is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find needed
        bbappended files.

    - subject: Increase timeout for filesystem label
      hash: 9184e01e4f42b95df53f440b4638a8acd9877a9c
      body: |
        The label is actually a udev symlink, but we're keeping
        this naming to be consistent across the file.

        The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't
        able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service dependency:
        resin-partition-mounter[440]: ERROR: Timeout while waiting
        for filesystem label to appear

        By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should
        already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is
        looking for this dependency.

        The original 60s might be slow for some devices where balena

        is functioning correctly, the healthcheck will assess the
        device as unhealthy and restart balena and/or the supervisor.

      body: |
        The current implementation checks for the existance of the `flash-boot`
        label. This breaks when after flashing the flashing device is left
        plugged. Change this with a check based on the root kernel argument.

    - subject: 'resin-vars: Implement custom ssh keys service'
      hash: 6d2e43d4693208c8df9436ea1f96c844b4faeb75
      body: >
        This patch adds support for translating SSH public keys from config.json

        to an authorize_keys file. We use `authorize_keys_local` file as the

        destination file of this translation so we can differentiate in between
        keys

        brought locally from config.json and keys brought from the balena
        backend

        through os-config an avoid racing issues with this tool (os-config). The
        final

        `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in the
        dropbear

        service.


        These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be provided

        as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

        {
          [...]
          "os": {
            "sshKeys": [
              "ssh-rsa ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
              "ssh-rsa 0123456789"
            ]
          },
          [...]
        }

      body: |
        This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
        DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

        The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
        v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
        if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

        Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
        fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
        an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

        The update in balena adds support to pass an argument to mobynit which

        The command ./mobynit -sysroot /mnt/sysroot/inactive will mount the
        rootfs partition from /mnt/sysroot/inactive and return the destination
        path in stdout.

    - subject: Fix proxy when using containers over bridge network
      hash: 3df6e1906e1138a8cd10d15ac3008685b90f75f8
      body: |
        Before multicontainer support in resin, the user container was running
        over the host's network stack which means that all the packets were
        treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication was
        redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.
        In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of bridge
        network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In this case,
        the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the redirection to
        redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.
        This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets to
        redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks too.

        As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to redsocks.
        This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if the
        redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

        We would like resin-altboot service to run before balena starts
        resin-altboot checks if the boot configuration is set to run
        resinOS from rootA(B) but we are actually running rootB(A) due to
        something.

        If rollback-altboot triggers, it will run hooks to refresh boot files
        and reboot. There is no point starting balena in such a device state
        as that will only slow down the hooks from running.

      body: |
        This recipe adds a few systemd services and scripts that handle
        automated OS rollback functionality.

        The rollback-altboot.service checks if we are running in altboot mode
        i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But we are
        actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen if
        a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in resinOS_uEnv
        txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.

        The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change the
        bootfiles.

        The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if vpn is
        online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

      body: |
        This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.

        If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the
        partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env
        variables.

        To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following in
        their u-boot

        Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending on the
        device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether that
        is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.

        If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the boot
        partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"

        E.g. for rpi3
        CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y
        CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y
        CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000

    - subject: Update HUP grub hook to support Automated Rollbacks
      hash: 620d7a4466dd2aea0c3c5e4ffc95ac22e7f7651c
      body: |
        Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra
        variables upgrade_available and resin_root_part in their grub.cfg
        files.

        Check for the presense of those variables and update them if they
        exist.

        Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg

        For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the pattern
        that exists in u-boot.
        i.e.
         Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
         Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
         upgrade_available is set
         Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
         reaches 2.

      body: |
        u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to reduce
        writes to sd card.

        If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the bootcount
        variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that u-boot
        starts counting.

        It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set
        upgrade_available=0

        For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot partition
        in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running hooks

        Pin down cargo deps (using Cargo.lock) to versions known working with
        rust 1.24.1 (for sumo)
      hash: ef3e76f2d343e8cd367214b4b5ce52b3b97be262
      body: |
        With Sumo 19.0.1, when building cargo 0.25.0 we get:
        | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module `fs`
        |   --> /yocto/resin-board/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cargo-native/
        0.25.0-r0/cargo_home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/
        libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26
        let config = fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?

        This is just one example of a package that fails like this. There are
        multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this error.

        The cargo bbclass does a:
        cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release

        This has the following effect:
        NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.
        Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`

        Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned upstream.
        In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that require a
        newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0). But at the
        same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust version.
        (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)

        The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which pins
        the packages to versions which are known to work with rust 1.24.1,
        the version we use in sumo.
